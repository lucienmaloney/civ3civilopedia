America was the first of the European colonies to separate \nsuccessfully from its motherland, and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests \nwith its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with \nits own territorial exploration and expansion and with economic growth. American politics became increasingly democratic \nduring the 1820s and '30s. But a matter of freedom would bring the nation to its greatest crisis: the American Civil War. \nOn February 4, 1861 - a month before {Abraham Lincoln} (1860-1865) could be inaugurated in Washington - six Southern \nstates sent representatives to Montgomery to declare a new independent government. With Jefferson Davis at its head, the \nConfederate States of America came into being, set up its own bureaus and offices, occupied federal buildings, issued its \nown money, raised its own taxes, and flew its own flag.\n^    With the Union preserved, the nation entered a period of unprecedented prosperity after the long conflict and \nreconstruction. In the ensuing two decades industrial production, the number of industrial workers, and the number \nof factories all more than doubled. European immigration, westward expansion, urban growth, technological advances \nand a host of American inventions - including the telephone, typewriter, linotype, phonograph, electric light, cash \nregister, air brake, refrigerator car, and the automobile - contributed to the American explosion, while widespread \nuse of corporate organization offered new opportunities for large-scale financing of business enterprise and attracted \nnew capital.\n^    Militarily speaking, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was so brief and relatively bloodless as to have been a \nmere passing episode in the history of modern warfare, but it catapulted the United States into the world arena. \nBefore the 1890s, roughly speaking, most Americans had stubbornly adhered to the belief, as old as the\n\n",

But the United States had become a great power by virtue of its prodigious economic growth \nsince the Civil War; now many thought it ought to begin to act like one.\n^    In World War I, and again in World War II, \nAmerican industrial might and military technology proved decisive. However, the debacle of Vietnam, set in the morass \nof the Cold War, shook America's belief in its \"victory culture\" and \"manifest destiny,\" a malaise that would not pass \nfor 20 years. Lasting but 40 days, the Gulf War was easily won by the U.S.-led coalition at only slight material and \nhuman cost, but its sophisticated weapons - spearheaded by the American {F-15} fighters - caused heavy damage to \nIraq's military and economic infrastructure. With the declining power (and subsequent collapse in 1991) of the \nSoviet Union, the war also emphasized the role of the United States as the world's single superpower at the beginning \nof the 21st century, its culture and technology spreading around the globe.\n\n\n"

When used in a modern context, \"Arab\" refers to any of the Arabic-speaking peoples who \nreside on the Atlantic Coast of Africa, Southwestern Iran, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi-Arabia, Syria, and Iraq.  The \nearliest nomadic inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula herded their sheep, goats, and camels through an unforgiving \ndesert environment; while those Arabs who settled in the oases provided date and cereal agriculture as trade staples \nfor Arab caravans that transported spices, ivory, and gold from southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa to the \ncivilizations farther north.\n^    During the 7th century AD, Muhammad emerged as the prophet for the religion of Islam, which was widely adopted \nby the Arab community. Islam unified the Bedouins and the town-dwellers of the oases, and within a century, spread \nthroughout most of the present day Arab-speaking world.  The newfound social organization that followed Islam \noffered new possibilities for the Arabs as agricultural production and intercity trading, particularly in luxury \ngoods, saw significant increases.  Gradually, the triad of temple, court, and market formed, as well as a \nstandardized style of writing for laws and other texts.  New institutions also emerged, including: coinage, \nterritorial deities, royal priesthoods, and standing armies, which further enhanced Arab power.  Adherence to the \nreligion of Islam has become a global phenomenon.  Muslims predominate in approximately 30 to 40 countries, from the \nAtlantic to the Pacific and along a belt that stretches across northern Africa into Central Asia and the northern \nregions of the Indian subcontinent.  Despite the absence of any large-scale Islamic political entities, the Islamic \nfaith continues to expand, by some estimates faster than any other major religion.\n^    By proclaiming his message publicly, Muhammad gained followers.  {Abu Bakr} is noted as being the first male \nconvert to Islam and also as Muhammad's closest companion and advisor.  At the point of Muhammad's death, on June \n8th, 632 AD Muslims resolved the crisis of succession by accepting Abu Bakr as the first Caliph.  In his rule as \n",
      "description": "#DESC_RACE_Arabs\n^\n^\n^Caliph, Abu Bakr suppressed tribal, political, and religious uprisings, known as the Rida Wars, and brought central \nArabia under Muslim control.  These wars caused high casualties among the Islamic community, but through them, \nAbu Bakr not only ensured the survival of Islam, but also established himself as the undisputed leader of the entire \nArabian Peninsula. By undertaking direct expansion from Arabia into Iraq and Syria, he began the Muslim conquests \notherwise known as 'Jihad'.  Aside from Iraq and Syria these conquests penetrated regions including Anatolia, Nubia, \nLibya, and Iran.  While early Muslim forces consisted of very few soldiers, it's understood that they retained higher \nmorale and mobility than their enemies, as well as the luxury to retreat into the desert where they alone knew the \nlocation of water and grazing land.  The one military unit that was present in nearly all of the Arabic expansion of \nthe 7th to 9th centuries was the {Ansar Warrior}.  These warriors participated as infantry, but most commonly rode on \nhorseback.  The quality of the Arabian horses quickly led to these soldiers dominating the battlefield, making ample \nuse of their array of weaponry, which consisted of javelins, a sword, as well as bow and arrows.  Jihad is the only \ntype of war legitimized by Islam, yet the word itself is still misunderstood by Westerners.  'Holy War' is the \noften-used misleading translation of Jihad, which in fact is meant to consist of an individual's or a communal \n'struggle' against evil, within one's self, and in order to protect Islam, but never as a tool for conversion.\n^    Traditional Arab values have since been modified in the 20th century through the combined pressures of \nurbanization, industrialization, and Western influences.  While urban Arabs still tend to identify themselves \nmore by nationality than by tribe, village farmers revere the pastoral nomad's romantic way of life and claim a \nkinship with the great desert tribes of the past.  As heirs to the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians, \nHebrews, even to the Greeks and Indians, the societies created by Muslims bridge time and space.  The original \nArab tribes in less than 20 years after Muhammad's death defeated the Byzantine and Persian empires, occupied a \nvast territory from Libya to Persia, and then developed into the Arab, or Islamic, Empire known today.\n\n\n"

It is possible \nthat their migration southward was part of a general movement of peoples that followed, or perhaps helped trigger, \nthe collapse of the Toltec civilization. The Aztecs settled on islands in Lake Texcoco and in 1325 founded Tenochtitl�n, \nwhich remained their chief city. The basis of the Aztec's success in creating a great state and ultimately an empire was \ntheir remarkable system of agriculture, which featured intensive cultivation of all available land, as well as elaborate \nsystems of irrigation and reclamation of swampland. The high productivity gained by these methods made for a rich and \npopulous state. The empire the Aztecs established was equaled in the New World only by that of the Incas of Peru, and \nthe brilliance of their civilization is comparable to that of other great ancient cultures of the New and the Old World.\n^    Under a succession of ambitious kings they established a dominion that eventually stretched over most of \npresent-day Mexico. By commerce and conquest, Tenochtitl�n came to rule an empire of 400 to 500 small states, \ncomprising by 1519 some five- to six-million people spread over 80,000 square miles. Valor in war, notably in \nthe feared {Jaguar Warrior} formations, was the surest path to advancement in Aztec society, which was caste- \nand class-divided but nonetheless vertically fluid.

The incredible story of a wandering tribe that was able to build an empire in one century \n(from the beginning of the 14th century to the beginning of the 15th) can be largely explained by three main factors: \nthe Aztec religion, the thriving trade routes centered on Tenochtil�n, and Aztec military organization. \nIn 1502 the ninth\n\n",

The oldest known urban and literate \nculture in the world was developed by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia beginning in the late 4th millennium BC. \nFor centuries, Babylon was an insignificant suburb of the Sumerian capital of Ur until {Hammurabi} (1792-1750 BC) \ncame to power. Hammurabi unified the bickering Sumerians and Akkadians and created the famous Code of Hammurabi, \nthe most comprehensive code of laws of antiquity with 283 entries covering topics from criminal punishments to \nfamily laws. Under Hammurabi, Babylon became the commercial and political center of southern Mesopotamia, but \nits prestige and wealth made it a target for foreign conquerors. The city and empire would be ruled, in succession, \nby the Hittites, Kassites, Assyrians, Arameans and Chaldeans.\n^    Under the Chaldean leader Nebuchadnezzar II (605-561 BC), Babylon entered its second golden age, spanning \nthe 7th and 6th centuries BC. Aside from the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah, Nebuchadnezzar II is best known \nfor his efforts to rebuild Babylon and reorganize its military forces, returning it to glory as one of the great \ncities in the ancient world. The fabled Hanging Gardens were constructed at Nebuchadnezzar's decree, reportedly \nto help his Median wife overcome her longing for the \"mountainous scenery\" of her homeland. He also rebuilt the \ngreat Temple of Marduk and its ziggurat, collectively known as the Tower of Babel. Following Nebuchadnezzar's \ndeath, his successor Nabonidus failed to maintain the skilled {Bowmen} formations and the massive fortifications \nof the great city. When the Persians under Cyrus attacked in  539 BC, the capital fell almost without resistance. \nBabylon remained in Persian hands until Alexander the Great \noverthrew the Persian Empire.

In the 2nd century BC Mesopotamia became part of the \nParthian empire, and Babylon itself a buffer region between the Parthians and the Roman Empire. By the time of \nChrist, the city was an extensive field of ruins and largely deserted. In the 7th century AD, Mesopotamia was \nconquered by Muslim Arabs. Babylon passed into legend, and from that time forward the history of the Babylonian \nrealm is that of Iraq and Iran. The city itself would not be re-discovered until the initial surveys by the \nBritish archaeologist C.J. Rich in 1811 and 1817.

When barbarians \nsacked Rome and defeated the western armies a century later, the Byzantine Empire was the final bulwark of Roman civilization to stand\nagainst the increasing pressure from European barbarians to the north and Persia in the east.  Byzantine government was based largely on \nthat of Rome, although unlike Roman emperors a Byzantine emperor was elected by a threefold vote of the senate, the people, and the army.  \nTo govern the empire, Byzantine emperors relied on a labyrinthine system of advisors, ministries, and offices -- hence the pejorative \"Byzantine\" today, used to \ndescribe overly hierarchical and intrigue-prone systems.\n^    The golden age of Byzantium began when Justinian I and his brilliant wife {Theodora} became emperor and empress.  Under their rule, the Byzantine \ngeneral Belisarius undertook a series of dramatic and successful campaigns against the barbarian kingdoms that had risen in the ruins of Rome.  \nAfter earning imperial favor by ruthlessly quashing a popular revolt, Belisarius successfully fought the Ostrogoths in Italy, the Persians, and various \ntribes in North Africa.  His enormous popularity eventually caused Justinian to fear him, and he was eventually stripped of his command.\n^    Byzantine military reform came mostly during the reign of Heraclius, the son of Africa's imperial governor.  Arriving in Constantinople \nto restore order after a disastrous interregnum (marred by assassination, intrigue, and civil disorder), Heraclius placed tremendous power in the \nhands of the army.  It was also during the reign of Heraclius that Greek fire, the medieval precursor to napalm, was invented, and used extensively by \nByzantine ships called {dromons} in battle against Persian and barbarian ships.  Heraclius also ordered the army to emulate the \nbarbarian horse archers previously employed as mercenaries; the result was the cataphract, a heavily armored cavalryman who could fight with bow, sword, or lance.\n",
      "description": "#DESC_RACE_Byzantines\n^\n^\n^    After two hundred years of defeats and erosion, during which Byzantium lost virtually all of its possessions south of Asia Minor, the ascension \nof Basil I to the imperial throne in 867 marked a turnaround in Byzantine military fortunes.  Byzantine armies beat back the Arabs in the east and south, and despite \nseveral humiliating defeats at the hands of the Muslims, reasserted dominance over the eastern Mediterranean.  Syria, along\nwith the key city of Antioch, also came back to Byzantine control, along with Armenia and large parts of the Balkans.  For 150 years, Byzantium enjoyed civil \nprosperity and military victory.\n^    But new adversaries appeared where the old ones had fallen.  In 1071, Byzantium suffered two catastrophic defeats -- they lost their last toehold in Italy to the Normans, who had \nearlier sacked Constantinople during a crusade gone awry.  In the east, the Ottomans broke Byzantine power in Asia Minor forever at Manzikert, and the once dominant \nempire was reduced to a rump state comprising Constantinople, parts of the Balkans, and a few remaining provinces in western Turkey.  The heart of it, though, was \nnow ruled by the Turks.  Nonetheless, during this time, art, religion, and philosophy flourished within the walls of Constantinople.  It was as if the learned men\nof Byzantium were unaware of the threats lurking outside.  Another fateful event, the Schism of 1054, finalized the separation between the Byzantine (Eastern) and\nCatholic (western) churches.  This would lead to deep suspicion between the two churches, and western reluctance to assist Byzantium against the Turks years later.\n^    Eventually Byzantium was forced to resort to bribery and compromise with the Turks and the new western powers that coveted its territory and former influence. \nIn 1421, after a hundred years of co-existence with the Turks, the new sultan Murad II revoked all of the arrangements that had existed between the two empires.  As a \nlast resort, the Byzantine emperor begged Rome for help, but the Christian army sent to fight the Turks was utterly defeated.  In 1453, the Turks assaulted \nConstantinople itself, and the walls that had stood for over a thousand years finally fell, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n\n"

The effort of these refugees was realized in the foundation \nof Carthage.  The Romans knew the people of Carthage as \"Poeni\", a derivation of the word \"Phoenicians\", from which the \nadjective \"Punic\" is also derived.  Carthage is located in modern-day Tunisia, bordered by Algeria, Libya, and the \nMediterranean Sea.  Located roughly center of the triangular Cap Bon peninsula, it is surrounded by low hills and backed \nby the lake of Tunis, allowing for safe anchorage and an abundant supply of fish.  The resulting city site was well \nprotected, and easily defensible.  Carthaginian control extended as far southwest as Theveste in northern Algeria; \nthroughout which, a thriving agriculture developed.\n^    The actual stages of growth in Carthaginian power are unknown, but the process was largely complete by the start of \nthe 4th century BC.  Ancient sources indicate that Carthage had perhaps become the richest city in the world via trade in \nperishable goods such as textiles, un-worked metals, food, and slaves.  Tin, silver, gold, and iron were obtained in \nexchange for these manufactured and consumer goods.  Carthage maintained a monopoly of trade from the 6th to 3rd century \nBC by sinking all intruders and exacting recognition of its position from neighboring Mediterranean states.  This wealth \nwas attested by the vast mercenary armies it was able to maintain with a mintage of gold coins far exceeding that known \nfor any other advanced state of its time. \n^    While frequently led by Carthaginian soldiers, the majority of the Carthaginian armies was comprised of mercenaries.  \nCelts and Iberians contributed large numbers of infantry and horsemen, but {Numidian Infantry} dominated their ranks.  These \nNumidian mercenaries were equipped with loot from assorted engagements against Rome, and were generally regarded as capable \nsoldiers and spearmen.\n^    The First Punic War between Rome and Carthage resulted from attempts to garner control over lands and trade routes \nthrough Corsica and Sicily.  Carthaginians intervened in a dispute between the\n\n",
      "description": "#DESC_RACE_Carthaginians\n^\n^\n^two principal cities on the Sicilian coast, Messana and Syracuse, in order to establish their presence on the island.  Rome \nresponded by attacking Messana, forcing the Carthaginians to withdraw and later surrender, ceding Sicily and the Lipari \nislands to Rome.  The great Carthaginian general, Hamilcar, led Carthage against Rome in the First Punic War, and his son \n{Hannibal} was made to swear eternal hostility against Rome at an early age as well.  From the death of Hamilcar in 229 BC \nuntil his own death in 183 BC, Hannibal's life was one of constant struggle against the Roman Republic.  Hannibal made \ngood on his oath by instigating a second Punic war.\n^    During the Second Punic War Hannibal established base in Spain, from which he could wage war against Rome.  Hannibal \nrefused Rome's demand to withdraw from the Iberian Peninsula, and Rome renewed war on Carthage once again.  Rome controlled \nthe Sea, forcing Hannibal to lead his army overland through Spain, Gaul, and the Alps to reach Rome.  After this spectacular\nachievement, Hannibal undermined Rome through battlefield tactics and shrewd political maneuvering.  Once Hannibal's hold \nover northern Italy was established he maintained it until 203 BC, when he was ordered to return to Africa.  Roman forces \nmaintained pressure on Carthaginian strongholds, however, and eventually forced the Carthaginians out of Spain.  Carthage \naccepted the terms of peace, surrendering its navy and ceded Spain as well as the Mediterranean islands to Rome.\n^    The first and second Punic wars effectively deprived Carthage of its political power, but did nothing to quell its \ncommercial trade, which continued to expand rapidly.  This inevitably drew the envy of Rome's growing mercantile community, \nand was reason enough for the Roman Republic to goad the people of Carthage into one final war.  Despite determined and \ningenious resistance against a siege that lasted for two years, Carthage fell.  The third and final war between the Roman \nRepublic and the Carthaginians resulted in the final destruction of Carthage, the enslavement of its population, and Roman \nhegemony over the western Mediterranean.\n\n\n"

Much of what we know about Celtic culture today \nhas been derived from the insights of the various writers and geographers of the time; coupled with finds from \nCeltic burial sights located in Bavaria, Bohemia, and Upper Austria.  The Celts once formed a loose-knit \n'empire', inhabiting territory that stretched in a chaotic band across central Europe.  The writings and \nfindings of modern archeologists place Celtic civilization as ranging from the Atlantic Coast of the British \nIsles and northern Spain, to as far east as Transylvania and the Black Sea.\n^    The Celts lived as extended families, or clans, which banded together, in order to form larger tribes that \nwould occupy territory together.  A Knight and a High Chieftain typically governed these tribes, while a third \nprivileged class known as 'men of art', who are better known today as the Druids and Bards, extolled the feats \nof Celtic warriors in song and craft.  Celtic society was held together by a complex web of family ties and \nother obligations, within which, the warrior nobles would strive to attain wealth and prestige through \nagriculture, trade, and success in war; which they often used to create and fund their own family or tribe.\n^    At the age of fourteen, Celtic boys attained manhood and were permitted to bear arms, while girls became \neligible for marriage.  Young nobles and sons of freemen who reached their fourteenth birthday became clients \nof a famous lord or well-reputed Celtic Knight.  Such warrior retinues were called 'Fianna'.  These junior \nwarriors sought out and followed experienced warriors whose success could provide them with greater chances \nat their own wealth and glory.\n^    While the bulk of a Celtic army would typically consist of poorly armored spearmen, it was the warrior \nnobles who wielded swords that were the most feared.  These {Gallic Swordsmen} were wealthier than their peers, \nand could afford to equip themselves not only \n",

They often charged into battle \nbare-chested or completely naked, occasionally wearing vividly patterned pants or cloaks.  Similar to the \nViking Berserker, they began their battles by viciously taunting their enemies, and followed it with a mad \nrush against enemy lines.  This was standard behavior for skirmishes between clans, which were frequent in \nCeltic society.  These tribal conflicts provided starting points for young Celts who sought to openly display \ntheir bravery and skill as a warrior.  Celtic warriors were also known to serve as mercenaries to numerous \narmies of the classical period.  The best known of instance of this, is when Celtic mercenaries joined Hannibal \nin his invasion of Italy during the 2nd Punic War, contributing to victories against Rome.\n^    The Celts' previous capture and sack of Rome, headed by {Brennus}, also remained an indelible mark on Roman \nfolk memory, and was likely the instigator for Rome's merciless treatment of the Celts in subsequent wars.  \nThis mutual hostility did not cease until the Gauls and Britons were later formally incorporated into the Roman \nEmpire.\n^    Despite the writings and other information that paints the Celts as uncultured savages, the relatively \nsophisticated weapons, pottery, jewelry, and other equipment found at burial sites serves to remind us that \nthey were very far from being the savages they were once depicted as.  On the contrary, it in fact \nappears that the Celts maintained a rich culture that is survived by the modern Celtic and Gallic speakers of \nIreland, Highland Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales and Brittany.\n\n\t\n"

Most of China's cultural progress has been accomplished with relatively \nlittle outside influence; even when the country was ruled by such \"barbarian\" peoples as the Chin or Mongols, these \nwere soon absorbed into the fabric of Chinese culture. The casting of bronze and the development of an alphabet date \nfrom the period of the Shang dynasty - China's first, believed to have dominated north China from the mid-16th to \nmid-11th century BC. The overthrow of the Shang dynasty by the Chou (1111-255 BC) spanned three generations; although \nthe vibrant Chou culture produced some of history's greatest philosophers and artists, among them Confucius and Lao-zi, \nit was eventually supplanted by a \"barbarian\" invasion that established the brief Ch'in Empire (221-206 BC). \nThe subsequent Han dynasty was founded by Liu Pang, who assumed the title of emperor in 202 BC.

Though the first settlers \nof the Nile valley are thought to have arrived as early as 7000 BC, it wasn't until the legendary king Menes unified \nUpper and Lower Egypt that the region began to develop a cohesive sense of culture and identity. This First Dynasty \n(2925-2775 BC), with its capital at Memphis, was followed by 26 more over the next 2700 years. Writing was the major \ninstrument in the centralization and self-preservation of Egypt. The two basic forms of writing, hieroglyphs and the \ncursive form known as hieratic (used on papyrus), were invented at much the same time in late pre-dynastic Egypt \n(about 3000 BC). Writing was used chiefly for administration and until about 2650 BC no continuous texts were recorded; \nthe only literary texts written down before the early Middle Kingdom (1950 BC) seem to have been lists of religious \npractices and medical treatises. Another strength was the Egyptian religion, which was one of the most enduring of \nthe ancient world, through which Egypt became a highly stratified, highly efficient society. Egypt�s economic strength \nallowed for the support of a priestly class, who were tasked with the spiritual well being of the people yet able to \ndevote their time to the study of religion, astronomy, philosophy and mathematics. The priesthood also served the \nfunctions of a state bureaucracy, carrying out the edicts of the Pharaoh and managing his financial and diplomatic \naffairs. The great organizational and economic power of Egypt allowed the rulers to accomplish unmatched works of \nconstruction. The Great Pyramids of Giza, completed in the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2465 BC), still stand as one of mankind�s \nmost impressive feats of engineering and logistics.\n^    Previous to 1700 BC, no outsiders had ever held dominion over Egypt. That changed when the Hyksos, a Semitic \npeople, overran Lower Egypt. Thereafter, Egypt�s borders were defended by capable Libyan warriors and the elite often \nrode into battle in {War Chariots}, which were able to use speed to outflank opponents and break up organized formations \nof troops.

Alexander the Great liberated the Egyptians from Persian rule in 332 BC and established the city of \nAlexandria, which was to become the new capital of Hellenic Egypt under the rule of the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty \n(332-30 BC), the last Egyptian kingdom. The kingdom was one of several that emerged in the aftermath of Alexander's \ndeath and the struggles of his successors.

Her suicide marked \nthe end of Pharaohic rule and the beginning of Egypt's centuries as a Roman and Byzantine province. Although swept \nby the Islamic tide in 642 AD, Egypt was to remain under foreign occupation - Arabic, Ottoman, French and British - \nuntil after World War I, when she finally gained her independence from a British administration weary of overseas \nconflict. From 1922 through 1952, Egypt appeared to be one of the world�s most successful constitutional monarchies. \nBut it was ripe for revolution; the military coup of July 1952 led by Gamal Nasser, ironically, finally made Egypt \nan island of stability in a turbulent Middle East.\n\n\n"

Tribal migrations into Britain began about the middle \nof the 5th century. The first arrivals were invited by a British chieftain to defend his kingdom against the Picts \nand Scots. The first mercenaries were from three tribes - the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes - which located on the \ncoastlands of northwestern Germany. Eventually, these peoples would themselves topple the native kingdoms. But \nunity was fleeting; the subsequent Norman Conquest (1066) resulted in the subordination of England to a Frankish \naristocracy, and the introduction of feudalism to the Isles.\n^    The English Normans would eventually give rise to a \npurely British line of kings, the Plantagenets. Three centuries later, the Wars of the Roses was the final struggle \nbetween the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of the Plantagenets for control of the throne. When Henry Tudor, earl \nof Richmond, seized the crown in 1485, leaving the Yorkist Richard III dead upon the field of battle, few Englishmen \nwould have predicted that 118 years of Tudor rule had begun. {Elizabeth} I (1558-1603) proved to be the most able Tudor \nmonarch. No observer in 1558, any more than in 1485, would have predicted \nthat despite the social discord, political floundering, and international humiliation of the past decades, the kingdom \nagain stood on the threshold of an extraordinary age. Her reign ushered in two centuries of British exploration, \ncolonization, artistic and intellectual advances.

The mainstays of the Industrial Revolution, such as coal mining, textile production, and \nshipbuilding, upon which British prosperity had been built, were now impoverished or redundant.

Her most dramatic acts consisted of a continuing series of statutes to \ndenationalize nearly every industry that Labour had brought into public ownership during the previous 40 years. \nPromising that \"we shall govern as New Labour,\" the Blair government installed in general elections in 1997 accepted \nsome of Thatcher's foreign policies but also carried out the economic reforms it promised in its manifesto. \nIn retrospect, the 1990s were a period of transition, controversy and continuity in the United Kingdom, and for the \nroyal family...

In the 2nd century BC Rome intervened on the side of Massilia (Marseilles), \na Greek colony founded in 600 BC, in its struggle against the barbarian tribes of the hinterland. The result was the \nformation, in 121 BC, of the Roman Provincia; between 58 to 50 BC Caesar seized the remainder. From 395 the internal \nproblems of the Empire encouraged barbarian penetration of \nTransalpine Gaul. By 418, the Franks and Burgundians were established west of the Rhine, and the Visigoths had settled \nin Aquitaine. The period of the Merovingian and Carolingian Frankish dynasties (476-887) frames the Early Middle Ages. \n^    Following his ascension, the first Merovingian, Clovis (481-511), consolidated the position of the Franks in northern \nGaul. Clovis came to believe that his victories were due to the Christian God. Clovis' subsequent conversion assured \nthe Frankish rulers of the support not only of the Catholic Church but of the majority of their own subjects. By the \nrise of the house of Valois in 1328, France was the most powerful kingdom in Europe. Its ruler could muster larger \narmies than rivals; he could tap enormous fiscal resources; and the king's courts maintained royal supremacy. The \nhistory of France in the Late Middle Ages is dominated by efforts of its kings to maintain their suzerainty, efforts \nthat, despite French advantages, were long frustrated. \n^    The Hundred Years War was an intermittent struggle between \nEngland and France in the 14th-15th centuries over a series of dynastic disputes, including the legitimate succession \nto the French crown. The war's turning point was reached in 1429, when an English army was forced to raise its siege \nof Orl�ans by a relief force organized by {Joan of Arc}. Her insistence that only consecration at Reims could make a \ntrue king, chosen by God, led to further victories. Charles III was anointed in Reims in July 1429. By 1453, England \nretained only Calais, which it finally relinquished in 1558.\n^    With the ascension of the infant Louis XIII (1610-1643), the security of the country was again threatened as factions \ndisputed the throne.

Under the last Bourbons, \nFrance became the industrial and commercial center of Europe.\n^    These developments, although significant by themselves, \ngave rise to a still more momentous change: the French Enlightenment, a cultural transformation based on rationalism, \nempiricism, and an amorphous concept of freedom found in the influential writings of Rousseau (1712-78). Hence, what \nbegan in 1787 as a conflict between royal authority and aristocrats became a triangular struggle, with \"the masses\" \nopposing both absolutism and privilege. By any standard, the fall of the Bastille to the Parisian crowd was a monumental \nevent, a seemingly miraculous triumph of the people. But the Revolution soon degenerated in a reign of terror and chaos. \nUnlike others before him, Napoleon terminated the bloodshed, but at the price of suppressing freedom altogether. \nIn utter contrast to the Revolution, militarism became the defining quality of the Napoleonic regime. However, the \nrevolutionary fervor of the French citizenry was undiminished by the Napoleonic experience, and led to further \nrevolutions in 1830 and 1848, the latter leading to the Second Republic followed by the Second Empire (1852-1870). \n^    Following defeat in the Franco-Prussia War, the Third Republic was formed - surviving the First World War but \ncollapsing in the face of the German invasion in 1940.

At that time, Germanic culture extended from Scandinavia as far south as the Carpathians. Although \nit was heavily fortified, the frontier was never a barrier to trade or culture. Germanic fear of the Huns meant \nthat the Roman Empire could, in moments of crisis, mobilize at least the Goths, Burgundians, and Franks for mutual \ndefense. Soon after Attila's death in 453, however, the Hun empire collapsed, and Rome lost this hold over the \nGermans.\n^    The Merovingian kings and their Carolingian successors eventually brought much of what would later constitute \nGermany under Frankish control, but the ceaseless blows from Danes, Saracens and Magyars in the later 9th and 10th \ncenturies weakened the kingdom's cohesion.

Although bitterly opposed to each other, the Nazis and Communists during \nthe next decade succeeded in mobilizing the political and economic resentments generated by defeat and depression.  \nWhen Hitler finally became chancellor in January 1933, it was not on the crest of a wave of popular support but as \nthe result of ruthless political intrigue.\n^    World War II is appropriately called \"Hitler's War.\" Spearheaded by {Panzer} \nformations using revolutionary new tactics, Hitler came close to realizing his aim of establishing German hegemony in \nEurope. But the turning point of the war came with his decision to send his Panzers into Soviet Russia. Though at the \nend of 1942 an ultimate German victory still seemed possible, by spring 1945 the Third Reich was prostrate. As a \nlegacy of surrender and the ensuing Cold War, a truncated Germany was divided into two zones of military occupation. \nWhile under Soviet rule East Germany suffered and stagnated, West Germany's recovery from total economic and political \nprostration at the end of World War II was of such dramatic proportions as to become a modern legend.\n^    The swift and \nunexpected downfall of the Soviet order in Europe led to a unification treaty, ratified by the West German Bundestag \nand the East German People's Chamber in September 1990.

In 490 BC a Persian army under \nDarius I (522-486 BC) landed unopposed on the plain of Marathon; following an appeal to the Spartans, the Athenian-led \nGreeks won a decisive victory. A second invasion ten years later, blunted by the valiant stand by the Spartans and \nThespians at Thermopylae (481 BC), ended with the crushing defeat of the Persian fleet at Salamis. Sporadic fighting \nbetween Greek alliances and Persia continued for another 30 years, before the Peace of Callas (449 BC) finally ended \nthe hostilities. The surprising Greek triumph ensured the survival of Greek culture and political structures. \n^    Growing tensions among the victors led to the Peloponnesian Wars (431-404 BC), fought between Athens and Sparta. \nThe Athenian league was, in fact, an empire that included most of the island and coastal states around the shores of \nthe Aegean Sea, while Sparta was leader of an alliance of independent cities that included most of the major land \npowers of the peninsula.

The Hatti, or Hittite, Empire was one of the great powers of Mesopotamia, \nrivaling Babylon and Egypt in military strength and influence. The first Hittites probably came from somewhere in the Caucasus or \nRussia, but settled in central Turkey and later in Syria, areas whose plentiful natural resources, particularly metals, would prove \ncrucial to the power of Hatti. Early Hittite kings focused on consolidating their power in their chosen region, but {Mursilis I} \nproved more ambitious, opting to strike out and execute audacious raids against mighty Babylon. He had great success, and indeed \nwas able to undermine and destroy the ruling Amorite dynasty in Babylon -- the family from which most great Babylonian kings \n(including Hammurabi) came.\n^    When Mursilis was assassinated, a bloody struggle for the kingship followed; the eventual victor, Telipinus, formed his \nown legal code which helped mitigate later power plays. After that, the Hittite Empire fought brief wars with its neighbors, \nuntil the time for a reckoning with Egypt came. The famed battle of Kadesh, in 1299 BC, is one of the most well-known Bronze Age \nbattles. The Pharaoh {Ramses II} moved into Palestine with a large army of chariots and infantry, to be met by a Hittite force \nof equal size (yet also composed partly of {three-man chariots}, a much larger variant of the first wheeled fighting vehicles, which \npermitted the riders to fight hand-to-hand as well as at a distance). The Hittites were able to surprise the Egyptians near dusk, \nand only a dramatic force march by the Pharaoh's reserves prevented the total destruction of the Egyptian army. The Hittites were \nforced to retreat, but given the casualties they suffered, the Egyptians were unable to capitalize on the Hittite retreat and Ramses' \noverall objective, Egyptian control of Palestine and Syria, was not achieved.\n^    The Hittites are also suspected by archaeologists to be the first smelters of iron.

Where they had come from was a mystery. Yet, though their purpose for settling such a rugged and inhospitable landscape was unclear, the end result of their arrival is without doubt. In time, the Inca built an empire that spanned the Pacific coast (as far south as Argentina and as far north as Ecuador), some 2,000 miles of hills, mountains, valleys and coastline. I\nn just a short time (roughly 100 years), the Incan empire dominated South America and is, to this day, considered one of the finest empires the world has ever known. Beginning with the ninth ruler, {Pachacuti} Inca Yupanqui, the Inca began their \nexpansion. Pachacuti won his first military campaign against the Chanca people, where he refused to retreat despite insurmountable odds. From there, he consolidated his control over his cultural base, Cuzco, then moved north into the Urubamba Valley, which extended beyond the site where the lost city of Mach Picchu was later built. He then turned his army south and conquered the Colla and Lupaca tribes. Though not the first Incan ruler, Pachacuti was by many accounts one of the finest Pre-Columbian persons \nthat ever lived. A great military strategist, an architect, a skilled diplomat and a gifted religious philosopher, his teachings are still practiced by many Andeans today. \n^    Like many other groups that preceded the Inca (the Chimu, the Nazca, the Moche), \nIncan society was heavily dipped in the worship of powerful gods. Their pantheon contained such lofty omnipotents as Viracocha (the god of creation), Inti (the sun and father of the Inca Dynasty), Illapa (god of rain, thunder, and lightening), Pacha Mama \n(mother of the earth), and Mama Cocha (mother of the lakes). Grand ceremonies were held frequently to honor these gods, for the Inca believed that if one did not give thanks and obedience to the gods, bad things would happen.

Each province was controlled by a local governor called the [apu]; below him were the local rulers - the [curacas], and even lower still\nthe district headsmen - the [camayoc]. Through this governmental structure, the [Sapa-Inca] could rule the empire with impunity. Additional structures were also put in place, such as the Imperial road system, which was built along the steep inclines of mountains, interspersing bridges and stone walkways, stone steps and flat brick highways. To rule such a vast realm, the Sapa-Inca also needed constant information\n about the status of the far-flung reaches of the kingdom. To provide this information, the Inca formed the {Chasqui Scout} system. Chasquis delivered messages across the empire, relaying (by memory) important information from point to point. And in this\n way, a message about a peasant uprising hundreds of miles north of Cuzco could reach the king within a matter of days. Chasquis were also used by the army on campaigns to deliver messages between the moving columns. In addition, way-stations known as\n [tambos] were constructed at strategic points along the roads, giving travelers and important dignitaries a place to rest and prepare for the next leg of their journey. \n^    The Incan army was also well organized. When called upon to fight, each province would muster squadrons of men armed with maces, bows and arrows, slings, darts, and\n spears. During a battle, slingers would let fly a shower of rocks to soften the enemy lines. Then, archers would release their shafts, darts would fly, and then the shock troops would hit, in a torrent of screams and shouts meant to confuse and terrify the wavering opposition. Incan warfare was very successful. But nothing could prepare the\n empire for what was coming. \n^    After the glorious rise of Pachacuti and his son, Topa Inca, the empire began to erode under a series of internal and external disasters. A bitter civil war between half brothers Huascar and Atahuallpa stretched the empire to the breaking point. Atahuallpa won the war, quickly killed his half-brother, and declared himself king.\n But, in 1532 AD, Spanish Conquistadors, under the command of Francisco Pizarro, entered the Cajamarca Valley, brutally attacked Atahuallpa and his subjects, killing many and taking the Sapa-Inca hostage. Eventually, Pizarro killed Atahuallpa, pillaged\n the empire of its riches, and brought an end to the mighty Incan civilization. \n\t\n\n"

From about \n5000 BC, increasing numbers of settlements of subsistence agriculturalists began to appear throughout the Indus \nValley; by 2600 BC some of these villages grew into urban centers, forming the basis for the early Harappan \ncivilization, the peer of contemporary Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations. However, unlike these regions, \ncentralized imperialism, which was attempted in the Mauryan Period (325-185 BC), collapsed. Nonetheless, the \nascension of Chandra Gupta Maurya (321-297 BC) is significant because it inaugurated the first Indian empire; \nthe Mauryan dynasty was to rule almost the entire subcontinent except the southern coasts.\n^    Using {War Elephants} to good effect, he defeated Alexander's successor Seleucus, the ruler of the eastern \nGreek holdings in Iran and India. The result was a treaty by which Seleucus ceded the trans-Indus provinces to \nChandra and the latter presented Seleucus with 500 elephants for his own army. A century later, the disintegration \nof the Mauryan empire gave rise to a number of feuding kingdoms, the Guptas and Pajputs in the north and Chola, \nHoysalas and Pandyas in the south, unable to stand alone against the coming Islamic tide.\n^    The first Arabic raids in the subcontinent were made along the western coast and in Sind during the 7th and \n8th centuries, and there had been Muslim trading communities in India for decades before. The permanent military \nmovement of Muslims into northern India, however, dates from the late 12th century and was carried out by the \nTurkish dynasty that arose on the ruins of the Abbasid caliphate. Sultan Mahmud, who conducted more than 20 \ncampaigns in India from 1001 to 1027 AD and established a large but short-lived empire, laid the road to conquest. \nBy 1186 AD, the Mahmud realm had been destroyed by the Ghurids, who proceeded to conquer the Rajput kingdoms and \nestablish a Muslim sultanate in Delhi, from which a series of able Turkish overlords ruled the north until 1526 AD.\n",

Babur was a Mongol, a fifth-generation descendant of Timur and a 14th-generation \ndescendant of Genghis Khan. In a lightning series of campaigns commencing in 1511 AD, he overran the Punjab and \nHindustan. Akbar the Great (1556-1605 AD), his grandson, continued the conquest of the subcontinent, overrunning \nGujarat, Bengal and Rajasthan. At its zenith, the Mughal realm commanded resources unprecedented in Indian history \nand covered almost the entire subcontinent.\n^    The 16th and 17th centuries also saw the establishment and expansion of European trading organizations in \nthe subcontinent, principally for the procurement of rare resources. By 1740, the Portuguese, Dutch, English and \nFrench had all founded colonial settlements, but with the Seven Years' War the French holdings were surrendered \nto the British East India Company. The quarter-century following the bitter Indian revolt of 1857-59, which transferred \nthe company's rule to the crown, ended with the birth of nationalist agitation.\n^    The Indian National Congress held its first meeting in December 1885 in Bombay even as Indian troops were \nfighting in upper Burma under the British flag. {Mohandas Gandhi} (1869-1948), later known as Mahatma (\"Great-Souled\"), \nwas recognized throughout India as the spiritual leader of a nationwide movement for independence. The Jallianwala \nBagh (1919) massacre turned millions of moderate Indians from patient and loyal supporters of the British raj into \nfervent nationalists. The last years of British rule were racked by increasingly violent Hindu-Muslim conflict and \nintensified opposition to foreign rule. In July 1947, Britain's Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act, ordering \nthe demarcation of the dominions of India and Pakistan by midnight of August 14, 1947, and dividing within a single \nmonth the assets of history's largest and richest colony.\n\n\n"

At its greatest extent, the Five Nations occupied a vast territory around Lakes Ontario, \nHuron and Erie, in present-day New York state and Pennsylvania and southern Ontario and Quebec. Tradition credits \nthe formation of the Iroquois Confederacy, forged between 1570 and 1600, to Dekanawidah, born a Huron, who is said \nto have persuaded {Hiawatha}, an influential Onondaga who had become the Mohawks' war chief, to abandon cannibalism \nand advance \"peace, civil authority, righteousness, and the great law\" as sanctions for confederation. Cemented mainly \nby their desire to stand together against invasion, the five tribes united in a common council composed of clan and \nvillage chiefs; each tribe had one vote, and unanimity was the rule. In this form, the Iroquois used a combination \nof military prowess and skilled diplomacy to conquer an empire. Until their internal unity finally failed them during \nthe American Revolution, the Iroquois dealt with even the European powers as equals.\n^    For nearly two centuries before the American Revolution, the Iroquois stood athwart the path from the Eastern \ncoast to the Great Lakes, blocking the route to permanent settlement by the French and containing the Dutch and the \nEnglish. Throughout the 18th century the Six Nations remained consistent and bitter enemies of the French, who were \nallied with their traditional foes, the Algonquins and Hurons. The Iroquois' success in maintaining their autonomy \nfrom both the French and English was a remarkable achievement for an aboriginal people. But during the American War \nof Independence, a schism developed within the Iroquois Confederation. The Oneida and Tuscarora espoused the American \ncause, while the rest of the league, led by Chief Joseph Brant's Mohawks, fought for the British, decimating isolated \nAmerican settlements.\n",

The Yayoi culture that arose in Kyushu, \nwhile the Jomon culture was still evolving, spread gradually eastward, overwhelming the Jomon. Culturally, the \nYayoi represents a notable advance and flourished for some five or six centuries, from the 3rd century BC to the \n3rd century AD. The unification of Japan under the Yamato court, with the tenno (\"Emperor of Heaven\") at its center, \noccurred around the mid-4th century. The 6th century reign of Kentai (507-531 AD) represents a decline of Yamato \ninfluence both at home and abroad; the period can be characterized by the growing accumulation of power by regional \nleaders and a weakening of royal influence.\n^    After the Onin War, the power of independent local leaders increased markedly, and in many instances deputies \nof great shugo houses usurped the domains of their superiors; a new type of feudal lord, the daimyo, took their place. \nThis Sengoku (\"Warring States\") period was marked by constant conflict among many such lords. The Yamato court was \nresuscitated by efforts made within the royal family itself, primarily the reforms of Prince Shotoku, who drafted \nthe Seventeen-Article Constitution of 604 AD. The death of Shotoku in 622 prevented his Confucian ideals of government \nfrom bearing full fruit when the Soga family, regaining its former power, executed Shotoku's son Yamashiro and all \nhis family in 643. Two years later, princes Nakano and Nakatomi engineered a coup d'�tat within the palace, killing \nthe Soga family and wiping out all forces opposed to the imperial family. They then set about establishing a system \nof centralized government with the emperor as absolute monarch that would last 1000 years.\n^    In the late Heian period, the more powerful of the {Samurai} gathered in or near the capital, where they served \nboth the military needs of the emperor and also as bodyguards for the great noble houses.

Eventually, from among these warring Samurai clans arose the able \n{Tokugawa} Takechiyo, founder of the Edo shogunate (1603-1867 AD), which ended the incessant conflicts and brought \nreform and peace to the islands. Although Spanish and Portuguese traders and missionaries had been in Japan since \nthe mid-1500s, it was the arrival of a squadron of U.S. warships commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry in Uraga Bay \nin July 1853 that finally opened the nation to Western influence - and brought pressure for political reforms and a \nnational identity. The Meiji government that followed the overthrow of the shogunate set about the task of \nwesternization and the creation of a modern state, and moved Japan onto the world stage.\n^    Ironically, Japan's new, influential role - marked by the ensuing Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), \nJapan's involvement in the First World War and in the Allied intervention in Siberia following the Bolshevik \nRevolution of 1918 - led indirectly to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the horrors that followed. The summer of \n1945 brought disaster for the Japanese: the Americans took Okinawa in a bloody invasion, in August the Soviet \nUnion declared war and swept over Manchuria, and atomic bombs largely destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and \nNagasaki on August 6 and 9, respectively. The Pacific War came to an end on August 14, with the formal surrender \nsigned on September 2 in Tokyo Bay aboard the battleship USS Missouri. With postwar American aid, from 1952 to 1973 \nJapan experienced accelerated economic growth and social change.

These settlers were the original founders of what we know today as the Korean civilization.  \nThe immigrant tribes solidified into three rival kingdoms: Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla; and nearly simultaneously, the \nkingdoms achieved a complete centralization of power through wars of expansion, organized military systems, training \ninstitutions, and tribal aristocracies assembled within the capital cities.  The maturation of monarchies in the kingdoms \neventually eliminated the influence of the aristocracies, however, and the balance of power waxed and waned as each kingdom \nendeavored to unite Korea under their exclusive rule.\n^    By 935 AD a general named {Wang Kon} established the Koryo dynasty, which ruled the Korean peninsula until 1392 AD.  Koryo, \nfrom which the western word \"Korea\" is derived, was proclaimed as the successor to all of the conquered kingdoms and states.  \nIt was during the Koryo dynasty that Korea began to construct its own distinct cultural identity among the rest of the East-\nAsian civilizations.  A bureaucratic system was created in order to replace the archaic tribal system that had previously \ngoverned the country, and civil service examinations were utilized as a means to select only the most capable officials and \nprovincial magnates.  The new bureaucratic force reaped by the civil service examinations held the applied precepts of Buddhism \nin disdain however, and with the assistance of Confucian-scholar General Yi Song-gye, the disgruntled officials seized power \nand established reforms that brought about the end of the Koryo dynasty, replacing the Buddhist-based system with Confucianism.  \nThe Yi dynasty named Hanyang (modern day Seoul) as the new capital of Korea, and operated from it for approximately 500 years \nuntil the Japanese annexation of Korea occurred in 1910.\n^    During the reign of the Koryo and Choson / Yi dynasties the advent of popular arts, as well as the introduction of \nRoman Catholicism in the 17th and 18th centuries, propelled Korea even closer to the modern state that exists today.

Korean agriculture prospered as farming technology advanced.  \nThe cultivation of special crops such as tobacco and ginseng became possible, providing new and profitable trade products \nwhich consequently improved the standard of living for peasants drastically.  The government began to mint coins and collect \nfarm rent in cash.  Markets were established across the country, creating a national trade network.  Scholars switched focus \nfrom theory and speculation to matters of practical relevance, including the needs of society and state, while popular \nliterature and artistic works also came into fashion.\n^    At the onset of World War II in 1941, Japan attempted to obliterate Korea as a nation.  Hundreds of thousands of Koreans \nwere drafted to fight and work for Japan during the war while the Japanese continued to commit numerous atrocities upon the \nKorean populace.  The Korean provisional government organized the Korean Restoration Army to fight alongside Allied forces in \nChina until August of 1945, when Japan surrendered.\n^    The end of Japanese rule caused great political confusion among the liberated Korean population. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. \nsupervised the permanent removal of Japanese forces and government from Korea, dividing it along the 38th parallel and sharing \nthe task.  The Soviet army, however, was accompanied by a group of expatriated Korean Communists who were placed into key \npositions of power.  The Soviet Union installed a Communist-controlled government in the North, which adopted the political \nstructure of the Soviet Union.  This new agency became the only lawful Korean government recognized by the U.S.S.R, essentially \ndeclaring war upon South Korea.  South Korea was largely unprepared to resist a total invasion; aware of this, the U.S. \nCongress approved monetary and military aid to support South Korea.  The resulting war lasted for approximately three years, but \nin that time over two-fifths of Korea's industrial facilities, and one-third of its homes were destroyed.  On July 27, 1953 an \narmistice was arranged establishing a cease-fire and a demilitarized zone between the two Korean factions, which still exists \ntoday.\n\n\n"

The Maya developed their unique culture in one of the most inhospitable places on earth. The lowlands of northern Guatemala, western Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan peninsula, are hot and humid, teeming with jungles boasting an annual average rainfall of 120\n inches. And yet, these stalwart peoples toughed it out and forged a civilization that stands, to this day, as a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of ancient man. \n^    Where did the Maya originate? The earliest archeological evidence was discovered\n in and around Belize, and dates as far back as 1200 BC. Primitive tools and pottery, small religious figurines of animals and humans became abundant, and by 900 BC, small\n villages of one-room dwellings made of poles lashed together with henequen rope, began to appear everywhere. By 600 BC, the Maya were the dominant people in the region.\n Between 300 BC and 150 BC, Mayan villages grew into larger and more populous cities, ruled by powerful kings and noble families. It was during this so-called Pre-Classic\n period that Maya society defined its cultural identity. \n^    It was also during this time that the Maya began to worship a pantheon of gods, from the creator of the universe, [Huabku], to [Itzamna] (creator of man); from [Ix\n Chel] (goddess of childbirth), to [Chac] (the rainmaker � an all-important god to the peasant class); from [Yam Kax] (the young corn god), to [Ah Much] (the lord of death). As more and more gods were added to the pantheon, the rituals needed to glorify them\n became quite elaborate, and thus it was necessary to create a priest sect to maintain the ceremonies. \n^    One of the most important cultural traits developed during the [Pre-Classic] period was the act of human sacrifice. Though the Maya never practiced it as prominently as the Aztecs, various acts of blood letting became commonplace and (ultimately) essential to the Mayan way-of-life. Mayan kings ruled through semi-divine right, and they believed that their connection to the gods could only be maintained through ritual sacrifice.\n",
      "description": "#DESC_RACE_MAYANS\n^\n^Thus, temples (in the stair-step design) were constructed with sacrificial altars. On these altars were laid human offerings. Stone knives were produced and the bodies cut to let the blood flow. Then, with speed and determination, the chests were cut open and hearts ripped out. It was these ritual offerings that allowed Mayan kings and priests to hold absolute control over their subjects. \n^    By 300 AD, the Mayan Classic period was in full bloom. This was the age of kings.\n Great rulers such as {Smoke-Jaguar} (or Smoke-Imix), Pacal, Eighteen Rabbits, and Blue-Quetzal Macaw, rose to prominence and ruled brilliantly over their lands. Mayan society was divided into city-states, each with its own king and cultural center. During the Classic period, the political influence of various cities rose and fell:\n Chichen Itza, Palenque, Copan, and Tikal, to name a few. It was also during the Classic period that the Mayan military grew in organization and in strength. The Mayan soldier carried knives and spears, clubs, bows and arrows, {javelins}, and even perfected the art of throwing hornets nests (called [hornet bombs]) into enemy troops to create confusion and panic. For defense, they used small shields made of jaguar\n skins. And Mayan generals called upon their priests to [divine] the gods and determine the best place and time to attack the enemy. It was through warfare that the Mayans collected slaves to sacrifice to their gods.\n^    By 850-900 AD, Mayan culture began a decline that saw its ultimate dissolution. One city after another began to fade away into the jungle in this Post-Classic period,\n as the populations vanished. Where did the Maya go? There is no consensus on this matter, but there are many theories. Environmental evidence suggests that a massive drought (hastened by volcanic activity), lasting for decades, hit the Yucatan Peninsula\n around this time. Another theory suggests that the peasantry, dissatisfied with their rulers, revolted. Another suggests disease savaged the populations and destabilized the local economies. Whatever the reason, by 1100 AD, the last of the great Mayan cities\n were swallowed by the jungle, and there they lay fallow for centuries until wealth-seeking Conquistadors and archeologists unearthed their wondrous remains and\n reintroduced the Mayan culture to the world. \n\n\n"

When Temujin was nine years old, tribal rivals poisoned and murdered \nhis father Yesugei, creating a power vacuum in the tribe that resulted in the exile of young Temujin and his family as \nfugitives.  In time Temujin would return to claim his inheritance, forge political alliances, and vanquish old rivals. \nIn 1204 AD he summoned a kuriltai war council and proceeded to unite all local nomad tribes by force.  It was at \nthis time he received the title 'Genghis Khan', meaning 'Great Ruler'.\n^    China, at the time, was divided by three sects:  the Ch'in, who were the most powerful, reigned in the north at \nPeking; the Sung occupied the South; and the Hsi-Hsia, the weakest of the 3, inhabited the western flank of the Great Wall.  \n^    The Mongol conquest against China began in 1211 AD when the consolidated tribes of the Great Khan struck at the \nHsi-Hsia, with tremendous success.  Not impressed with the defeat of his weaker neighbor, the new Emperor of Ch'in insisted \non a public display of servitude from Temujin. Temujin reacted by ordering a general advance against the Ch'in Empire.  \nThe resulting war lasted for approximately 23 years, and ended in the complete destruction of the Ch'in. During this \ncampaign Temujin ensured that the epic war upon the Ch'in did not occupy all of his resources and time; there were older \nenemies to address.\n^    Amid the war against the Ch'in the Mongols also rallied against the Kara-Khitay, one of the original Kuchlug tribes \nthat had fled from defeat during Temujin's war of unification.  Victory over the Kara-Khitay provided the Mongols a common \nfrontier with the Shah of Khwarizm, who ruled a large Muslim state that stretched from modern day Iran to the southern \nSoviet Union as far as the Caspian and Aral seas.  In 1219 AD the Mongol horde gathered for the first of several large \noperations against Muslim and Persian enemies.  After defeating the Shah, the Mongols had access to Russia.  Not content \nwith remaining a peaceful neighbor, Temujin permitted his generals \n",
      "description": "#DESC_RACE_Mongols\n^\n^\n^to lead an extraordinary campaign into southern Russia, which would be staged largely in the winter months.  Three years, \nand numerous victories later, they returned to rendezvous with the main Mongol force and to contribute in the war against \nthe Ch'in and their Muslim enemies.\n^    Mongol children were taught to ride on horseback from the age of three, and were given bow and arrows to use for hunting \nat the age of five.  Horseback became a natural way for the Mongols to conduct war.  When speed was essential, a Mongol rider \ncould even sleep while in the saddle; and by using a system that consisted of approximately four remounts, Temujin's army was \ncapable of traversing 130 miles in two days, with no breaks for food.\n^    Another defining characteristic of a Mongolian army was the speed and voracity with which it was able to accept and \nprepare for battle.  The Mongol's harsh, nomadic lifestyle had prepared them well for the rigors of war; and they often \nthrived in conditions that would be considered intolerable by any other military of its time.  When the need arose they \ncould last up to ten days at a time without cooking food, during which they would sustain themselves by drinking the blood \nof their horses.\n^    Every victory wrought by the Mongols was followed by slaughters of incredible scale.  No citizens, with the exception of \nthose who were useful to the Mongol war effort, were spared in these attacks.  In 1221 AD, the Islamic city of Merv was \ncaptured; 700,000 were murdered, and a rearguard was assembled to dispatch any citizens who were fortunate enough to have \nescaped the original slaughter, this was routine for the Mongol army.\n^    By the end of the 13th century Mongol armies had been involved in action in countries including: Poland, Japan, Korea, \nHungary, Russia, Palestine, Persia, India, Cambodia, Burma, and Vietnam.  After Temujin's death in 1227 five more Khans \nwould follow, including, Kublai Khan, whose triumph was the union of all of China under his rule.  However, the death of \nKublai Khan in 1294 AD marked the end of an era for Mongol conquests, and the march of Mongol armies was never again \nresumed, leaving its populace to be absorbed into the sedentary life style of the neighboring people.\n\n\n"

The alliance would coordinate taxation and military operations\nagainst Spain, whose ruling Hapsburgs had dominion over the Low Countries even after they adopted the Protestant\nreligion. The Netherlands, comparatively small and poor compared to mighty Spain and its empire of gold in\nthe Americas, often had to rely on {Swiss mercenaries} and other hired guns for its defense. This was not a\nlong-term solution, hence the need for a much closer alliance. The result of this meeting was the Union of\nUtrecht, which formally created the United Provinces of the Netherlands.\n^    Spain, which had spent the previous decade alternately fighting and politicking against the armies and\nintrigues of {William of Orange}, was not pleased by this development. Orange�s position had always been that\nSpain�s sovereignty over the Netherlands was legitimate, but the governors chosen by the King were trampling\nthe rights of Orange and the other native nobles. William also vehemently opposed the imposition of Catholicism\non his homeland, but still felt the King of Spain could be persuaded to loosen his grip. This proved unrealistic,\nand in 1581 Orange publicly renounced his loyalty to the Spanish throne. He was assassinated a few years later;\nhe did not live to see his country completely free of Spanish domination.\n^    However, once the provincial leaders (particularly those of Holland, the largest and most influential of\nthe United Provinces) and the nobles began to cooperate, putting their disagreements to one side, Spain was\nnearly defeated. Under the brilliant political, military, and economic leadership of Johan de Witt, perhaps\nthe Netherlands� greatest statesman, the Dutch Republic grew into a world power, its rapidly growing economy and\nnaval presence allowing it to settle colonies around the world and establish a massive trade empire. This\nwealth translated into a cultural golden age lasting over a hundred years.\n^    During that time, Dutch thinkers made fundamental contributions to philosophy, law, science, and art.\nHugo Grotius, a lawyer and\n",

The philosopher Baruch Spinoza published substantial revisions of his mentor Rene\nDescartes� rationalist works, and also wrote a lengthy defense of freedom of conscience �- which was promptly\ndenounced as heresy by his contemporaries. In art, an obscure portrait painter named Rembrandt van Rijn rose\nto prominence (and disapproval) for his religious paintings and figure studies. Peter Paul Rubens, a great painter\nin his own right, also ran an immense school for artists, attracting dozens of talented painters from all over\nEurope to the Netherlands. The mathematician Christiaan Huygens developed his wave theory of light, which was a\ngiant leap in the study of optics pioneered by Isaac Newton. And biology was made incomparably easier by Antonie\nvan Leeuwenhoek�s invention of the microscope.\n^    After the Golden Age, the Netherlands retreated into the background, as the English fleet gradually achieved\nits supremacy. By the Napoleonic era, the Netherlands was once again dominated by its neighbors.

Narratives indicate that Osman's tribe, the Kayi, fled west from the Mongols in the 13th century and took \ncontrol of a freebooting army of nomads and Muslim peasants who inhabited the rugged stretch of wasteland along \nthe Byzantine frontier.  This band of refugees enjoyed close ties to Muslim guilds and religious brotherhoods in \nlocal towns that were led by Sheikh Edebali, who allowed Osman to form a tiny state around his castle of \nKaracahisar.  Turkish warriors and religious leaders who also fled from the pagan Mongols in the east quickly \npopulated this region, ruled by Osman.  Osman directed his community through the Kara Su valley to seize \nYenisehir, and establish it as the first true Ottoman capital.  The Ottoman state emerged, poised above the \nfertile shores of the Sea of Marmara.\n^    Osman continued to wage a slow but persistent war against the Byzantine Empire who endeavored to defend \ntheir territories along the Asiatic shores that were opposite of Constantinople (now Istanbul).  His first \nvictory over a Byzantine army at Koyunhisar in 1301 AD perpetuated Osman's fame, and settlers flocked to Ottoman \nterritory as a result.  Osman extended his control over several other Byzantine fortresses, providing the \nOttomans with strong bases from which they could lay siege to Bursa and Nicaea in northwest Anatolia.  The \npinnacle of Osman's reign occurred at the conquest of Bursa shortly before his death.\n^    Initially, Ottoman war tactics were no different than those used by the tribal Turks.  They would first \nharass the foe with horse-archers, employing hit and run tactics, only closing in on the enemy when they became \ncompletely disorganized.  Thus, the earliest Ottoman successes were won against isolated Byzantine garrisons, \nbut rarely against a field army.

During their earliest exploits, the Ottomans were frequently frustrated by fortifications \nand the exhausting sieges that were required in order to overcome these defenders.  This changed in the 15th \ncentury and beyond as imported expertise in firearms and gunpowder led to some of the most massive artillery of \nthe time.  A form of Turkish heavy cavalry, known as {Sipahi}, became the predominating military unit utilized by \nthe Ottoman Empire.  The earliest variations of these soldiers were well-armored men on well-armored horses, \nwho typically used a mace as their primary weapon.  During the 17th century the Sipahi replaced their archaic \nweaponry with sabers and pistols, establishing them as a fearsome presence on the battlefield.  While European \ninfantry were more than a match for the standard Ottoman infantry, the Sipahi were far superior to any \nmedieval knights.\n^    During their period of expansion, the Ottomans visualized Europe as Americans would later see their Western \nfrontier: a land of destiny.  The conquest of Istanbul in 1453 AD initiated this by uniting Muslim Anatolia and\nChristian Rumelia under the Ottoman Sultan's protection.  However, this attitude would change as the Ottomans \nwere forced to go on the defensive during the 17th and 18th centuries.  Ottoman defeats were followed by mass \nslaughters of Muslim minorities.  These massacres characterized the war between Christian and Turk in the 19th \ncentury.\n^    At its height, the Ottoman Empire territory included Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, Greece, the \nUkraine, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Egypt, a large section of North Africa, and most of the Arabian Peninsula.  Over \ntime, however, Sultans grew weary of their administrative duties and withdrew from public affairs.  The office of \nGrand Vizier was created to act second only to the sultan in authority and revenue, but while the Grand Vizier \nwas able to stand in for the sultan in an official capacity, he could not take his place as a focus of loyalty \namong the different classes and social groups in the empire.  This separation of political loyalty and \ncentralized authority led to a decline in the government's ability to impose its will, which inevitably led to \nthe Ottoman Empire's end in 1922, when it was replaced by the Turkish Republic.\n\n\n"

The first mention of the Parsa occurs in the annals of Shalmanesar \nIII, an Assyrian king, in 844 BC. Cyrus II (559-529 BC), heir to a long line of ruling chiefs in Mesopotamia, was a \ntolerant and venerated monarch, called the father of his people by the ancient Persians. After a successful revolt \nagainst his Achaemenian overlords in 550 BC and inheriting the kingdom of the Medes, Cyrus consolidated his rule on \nthe Iranian Plateau and extended it westward across Asia Minor.\n^    In October 539 BC, Babylon, the greatest city of the ancient world, fell to his Persian forces. Following the \ndeath of Cyrus' heir, Darius I (522-486 BC), a leading general and one of the princes of the Achaemenid family, \nproclaimed himself king following suppression of a number of provincial rebellions and challenges from other pretenders \nto the throne. Darius was in the mold of Cyrus the Great - a powerful personality and a dynamic ruler. To consolidate \nhis accession, Darius I founded his new capital of Parsa, known to the Greeks as Persepolis (\"Persian City\") and \nexpanded the ranks of his personal bodyguard, the {Immortals}.\n^    Although Darius consolidated and added to the conquests of his predecessors, it was as an administrator that \nhe made his greatest contribution to Persian history. During his reign, political and legal reforms revitalized the \nprovinces and ambitious projects were undertaken to promote imperial trade and commerce: coinage, weights and measures \nwere standardized, and new land and sea routes explored and established.\n^    Such activities, however, did not prevent Darius from following an active expansionist policy.

Expansion to the west began about 516 BC when Darius moved against the Greek colonies \nalong the coast of Asia Minor.\n^    {Xerxes} (486-465 BC), son and successor of Darius I, was determined to continue the Persian conquest of the west \nand is best known for his massive invasion of Greece from across the Hellespont in 480 BC, a campaign marked by the \nbattles of Thermopylae, Salamis and Plataea. Although successful in the pacification of Egypt and suppression of a \nBabylon revolt, his defeat by the allied Greek city-states spelled the beginning of the decline of the Persian Empire. \nSoured by these reversals, Xerxes retired to his palaces at Susa and Persepolis. In his last years, he squandered the \nonce-enormous treasury he had gathered through trade and taxation by launching vast construction programs, most never \nfinished.\n^    The death of Xerxes was the final turning point in Persian influence. Occasional flashes of vigor and ability by \nsome of Xerxes' successors were too infrequent to prevent eventual collapse. The final act was played out during the \nreign Darius II (423-404 BC), who rose to the throne through palace intrigue. Darius was able to put down yet another \nrebellion in Egypt in 337-336 BC, but the beginning of the end came soon afterward with his defeat at the Battle of \nGranicus (334 BC) by Alexander the Great. Persepolis fell to the young Macedonian conqueror in April 330 BC, and Darius, \nthe last Achaemenid, was murdered in the summer of the same year while fleeing the Greek forces. In the struggle for \npower after Alexander's death, Seleucus I brought under his control the Persian provinces of Alexander's empire. But \nthis unity was short-lived, as the Indian holdings successfully revolted and the Seleucid kingdom broke into the \ncompeting nations of Parthia and Bactria. The last vestiges of Persian culture disappeared with the advent of Islam \nand the Arab conquest (640-829 AD) of Iran.\n\n\n\n"

Impolitely, he took that opportunity to declare Portugal independent of Castile, with\nhimself as king of the new country. He was able to get away with it largely due to the recognition by the\nChristian kingdoms of Spain that the Muslims were the common enemy, and when assured that Portugal would still play\nan active role in the impending Reconquista, Castile-Navarre and Aragon were willing to overlook Henriques�\nimpudence. Two hundred years later, once the Muslims were confined to their tiny corner of Spain in Granada,\nCastile saw fit to repossess the Portuguese kingdom. When the Castilian army was soundly thrashed in battle by\nthe warrior king John of Aviz, it was clear to all that Portugal was there to stay.\n^    After the victory over Castile and the collective reconquest of Iberia from the Muslims, Portugal looked\noverseas to continue its expansion. King John led a campaign against Ceuta in North Africa (modern-day Morocco).\nThe ease of Ceuta�s conquest caught the attention of his third son, {Prince Henry the Navigator}. Henry�s\nolder brother Duarte succeeded to the throne after John�s death, and the two were often at odds, with Duarte\nskeptical and suspicious of Henry�s ambitions to explore new lands and convert the natives to Christianity. For\nthe next twenty years Henry sponsored expeditions to western Africa, and even led a campaign to invade Tangiers\nin 1437 (which ended in defeat). But on the whole Henry�s personal seafaring experience was limited; his\nsobriquet comes from his patronage of other adventurers and the resulting age of discovery and colonization that\nthey inaugurated with his support.\n^    Portuguese explorers continued their discoveries after Henry�s death in 1460. The greatest was Bartolomeu\nDias, whose 1488 voyage around the southern coast of Africa made Europe aware of the Indian Ocean and a shorter\nroute to India than the one Columbus gambled on just four years later.

He made three trips to India over the following thirty\nyears, the last of which took place in 1524 after his appointment by the King as viceroy of India. He did not\nlive long after his arrival; some speculate he was poisoned by corrupt administrators who feared punishment at\nhis hands.\n^    In 1543, Portuguese sailors were shipwrecked in Japan. They did not stay long, but left behind the technique\nof musket-making �- in that way, a handful of men changed Japanese history forever, as the samurai era was drowned\nby the sound of musketfire. By that time Portugal�s overseas holdings were vast, comprising holdings all over\nAfrica, India, China, Macao, and South America.\n^    In 1580 Spain awoke, flexing its muscles as the world�s pre-eminent power. It took the opportunity to\noccupy Portugal, and for almost 100 years the two countries were united. The Portuguese royalty did not give\nup, though, and through clever diplomacy and alliance with England they were able to restore their monarchy and,\nwith Spain greatly weakened and demoralized by the Thirty Years� War, finally forced Spanish recognition of\nPortuguese independence. Portugal remained an influential and wealthy European power through the Napoleonic Wars,\nwhen its alliance with Britain gave the British a foothold on the Continent to oppose Napoleon�s armies.\n^    Portugal�s prosperity lasted until the 1890s, when a combination of inflation and sluggish\nindustrialization undermined its industries. Dissatisfaction with the monarchy led to a coup and the establishment\nof a republic in 1910; this did not last long, as radical groups pursued extreme agendas and unrest grew. In 1926,\nthe army bloodlessly overthrew the republic; the junta asked a university professor and occasional member\nof parliament named Antonio Oliviera de Salazar to assume control of all economic policy. Six years later,\nSalazar became prime minister, a limited office in theory but dictator in practice. Salazar�s new\nconstitution formalized his powers and he ruled Portugal with absolute authority for nearly 40 years.\n^    In 1968 Salazar suffered a stroke; his ministers tried to continue the dictatorship but in 1974 a\ndemocratic revolution re-installed a republican form of government. After narrowly avoiding a Communist coup,\nPortugal flourished, although it presently faces structural problems similar to those of its nearest\nEuropean neighbors.\n\n\n\n"

Rome was built on a site highly prized by the Etruscans, who \ndominated the Italian peninsula in the 6th century BC. The Etruscan king Porsenna defeated the Romans and expelled \nTarquinius Superbus. Yet before Porsenna could establish himself as monarch over the unruly Romans, he was forced \nto withdraw. Rather than restoring their inept king, the citizens replaced the monarchy with two elected consuls, \ngenerals whose primary task it was to lead Rome's armies, and a Senate to serve as an advisory body. Where the \nEtruscans had failed, the people of Rome succeeded in the task of unifying the various Italian peoples into a \npolitical whole.\n^    Toward the end of the 5th century BC, the Romans, propelled by the pressures of unchecked population growth, \nbegan to expand at the expense of nearby city-states. Rome's first two wars were fought with Fidenae, an independent \ncity near Rome, and against Veii, an important Etruscan city. In the process, the expanding Roman Republic found the \nGreek phalanx formation too unwieldy for fragmented fighting in the hills and valleys of central Italy; accordingly, \nRome evolved a new tactical system based on flexible ranks of cohorts, organized into self-contained {Legions}, the \nmeans by which Imperial Rome conquered and ruled the ancient world.\n^    When Rome became increasingly powerful, the remaining city-states took up arms; the ensuing Latin War (340-338 BC) \nwas quickly decided in Rome's favor. By 264 BC all Italy south of the Alps was united under the leadership of Rome, \nits members either incorporated in or allied with the Republic. Rome's growing influence led it into conflict with \nCarthage, an established commercial power in northern Africa.

The ensuing period of unrest and \nrevolution marked the transition of Rome from a republic to an empire. The later stages of these civil wars encompassed \nthe careers of the brilliant Pompey, the orator Cicero, and the consul {Julius Caesar}, the conqueror of Gaul (58-50 BC), \nwho eventually was given power over Rome as its dictator. After his assassination in 44 BC, it was not long before civil \nwar again erupted; but following his victory at Actium (31 BC), Octavian, Julius' nephew, was crowned Rome's first \nemperor, Augustus 27 BC-14 AD). Although there were exceptions such as Caligula (37-41) and Nero (54-68), Rome was \nblessed with a series of able and brilliant leaders who expanded the frontiers until Rome's empire reached from Britain \nto Egypt and from Spain to Persia.\n^    Imperial Rome was distinguished not only for its military - the foundation upon which the empire rested - but \nalso for its accomplishments in engineering and statecraft. The Romans were gifted in the applied arts of law, \nrecord-keeping and city planning, yet they also acknowledged and adopted the contributions of earlier peoples - \nmost notably, those of the Greeks, much of whose culture was thereby preserved. Roman law was a complex body of \nprecedents and opinions, which were finally codified in the 6th century as the Justinian Code. The empire's road \nnetwork was without match in the ancient world, designed for rapid movement of commerce, agriculture, mail delivery \nas well as the army. Roman city planners achieved unprecedented standards of hygiene with their plumbing, sewage \ndisposal, dams and aqueducts.

Modern Russia dates from about 770, when Viking \nexplorers began an intensive penetration of the Volga region. From bases in estuaries along the eastern Baltic, \nScandinavian bands, probably in search of new trade routes to the east, began to penetrate territory populated \nby Finnish and Slavic tribes, where they found unlimited natural resources.\n^    Within a few decades the Rus, as the Viking settlers were known, together with other Scandinavians operating \nfarther west, extended their raiding activities down the main river routes toward Baghdad and Constantinople, \nreaching the Black Sea in 860. In the period from 930 to 1000, the region came under complete control by the Rus \nfrom their capital at Novgorod.\n^    The lifeblood of this sprawling Kievan empire was the commerce organized by these Viking princes. Novgorod's \nburghers even forged an accommodation with the invading Mongols during the 13th century, but its absorption by the \ngrowing Slavic principality of Muscovy in 1478 ended its political independence.\n^    Ivan III (1462-1505) consolidated the gains his father, Vasily II, had won in the saddle. This \"gathering of \nthe Russian lands\" became a conscious and irresistible five-century drive by Moscow to annex all Slavic lands, both \nthe Russian territories and the Belorussian and Ukrainian regions. The ascension of Peter I (the Great; 1694-1725) \nushered in and established the social, political and intellectual trends that were to dominate Russia for the next \ntwo centuries. The location of his capital, St. Petersburg, on the shores of the Gulf of Finland symbolized this \nshift toward a European involvement. \n^    {Catherine the Great} (1762-1796) would prove to be Peter's true intellectual and political heir.

In the \nprocess, the military democracies of the {Cossack} hosts along the Dnieper, Don and Volga rivers lost their autonomy \nand special privileges; the wealthier officers became Russian nobles, receiving the right to own and settle serfs on \ntheir own lands, while the fierce horsemen sank to the level of peasants with special military obligations.\n^    Despite the heritage of Peter and Catherine, by the time of Nicholas II (1894-1917) Russia was in disarray, \nfighting an onerous war and plagued by internal misery and oppression. The Kerensky provisional government, a \nmoderate attempt to resolve the problems, collapsed in the face of the Bolshevik revolution. Given the Bolshevik \ndesire to dominate the whole of Russia and the rest of the former tsarist empire, civil war was inevitable. Stalin \nwould complete the consolidation of Communist power begun by Lenin. And he would lead Soviet Russia through the \ngreatest threat to its existence, and help it emerge as one of the world's superpowers following the Second World War. \n^    But in the ensuing Cold War, Russia's economy tottered towards collapse. The people turned to Boris Yeltsin, \na liberal Party functionary. Elections to the Congress of People's Deputies in March 1989 saw him score a stunning \nvictory. He used his newfound legitimacy to promote Russian sovereignty, to advocate and adopt radical economic reform, \nto demand Gorbachev's resignation, and to negotiate treaties with the Baltic republics, in which he acknowledged their \nright to secede from the union. An ill-conceived, ill-planned, and poorly executed coup attempt to unseat Yeltsin \noccurred August 1991, bringing an end to the Communist Party and accelerating the movement to disband the Soviet \nUnion.

The most logical explanation to date is the possible overpopulation of the region.  An explosion in \nNordic population throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark during the 7th and 8th centuries may have \nforced the indigenous people to explore and settle in more favorable territories. In addition, the gradual \nestablishment of government throughout most of Western Europe augmented mercantile trade greatly as well as the \nopportunities for piracy. At home, these Scandinavians were independent farmers, but at sea or on the fields of \nwar they were some of the fiercest warriors in the world.\n^    The Scandinavian art of shipbuilding evolved during the course of the 8th century and greatly facilitated these \nearly Viking expeditions and raids.  The most distinct differences between the Viking ships and their merchant \nvessel victims, was that the merchant ships were short, broad and relied on sail power, while Viking warships \nwere longer, thinner and had a far greater number of oars and men. This made the Viking ships notably faster, \nand was instrumental in allowing the Vikings to penetrate long distances up rivers. Small armies of Viking \nlongships negotiated the seas, utilizing hit-and-run tactics on the cities, towns, and villages that dotted the \ncoasts of Europe. These longships were the very tools of Viking expansion.  The Vikings were able to raid far \nafield and subsequently colonize the lands that they plundered.\n^    Viking hordes attacked England at the end of the 8th century, after which followed a period of relative calm \nthat was shattered years later when attacks began anew. At first, the Vikings led nothing more than predatory \nraids in the summer months in search of booty and slaves, with no attempts at permanent settlement.

Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan, and Ubbi (or 'Hubba') brought military ambitions with them.  \nRagnar's sons captured York at the end of 867; and then proceeded to overrun most of Northumbria, Anglia, and \nMercia. Ivar advanced to Dublin to conquer it, later dying in the Battle of Ashdown in 871. Halfdan became the \nchief leader following Ivar, where he defeated the English at Basing, Meretun, Reading, and Wilton. For the next \nfew years the Vikings concentrated on securing conquests in eastern and northern England. They divided Northumbria \nand Mercia amongst themselves, and Halfdan followed in Ivar's footsteps in another attempt to secure Dublin from \nIreland, only to be defeated by Norwegian Vikings in 877.\n^    The Scandinavian countries seemed to possess an inexhaustible supply of able-bodied warriors and manpower.  In \nland battles Vikings favored overlapping shield-wall formations, which consisted of approximately 5 or more ranks \ndeep of the most heavily armed and armored Vikings forming the exterior of a line, wedge, or circle formation to \nabsorb the brunt of enemy attacks. In the pagan era, before Scandinavia was converted to Christianity, the \n{berserkir} warriors were looked upon as possessing supernatural powers attributed to the Viking's chief god, Odin; \nand a belief in lycanthropy. These warriors were known to rush into battle without armor, as mad as wolves, and \nas strong as wild boars. This infamous berserkir frenzy reportedly allowed them to kill men in single blows with \ngreat bearded axes, and shrug off blows from fire and iron alike.  Today it is believed that these frenzies were \nthe result of epileptic attacks.\n^    The era of the Viking lasted only 300 years, ending at approximately 1066AD; around the time of the approximated \ndeath of Harald Hardrada, who died heroically in battle.

The Conquistadores \nundertook their expeditions in the vast landmasses of the Americas at their own expense, risking their lives without aid from \nthe Spanish royalty.  Their conquests included campaigns in Guatemala, Peru, Cuzco, Columbia, Chile, the Bay of Honduras, and \nas far as the Pacific Coastal regions.  The Conquistadors, however, were given to fighting and searching for gold, and were \nswiftly replaced by administrators and settlers from Spain who governed in their place.\n^    Once the Spanish Kingdom established its presence in the Americas their operations inevitably became high-profile targets \nof pirates and other raiders who were endorsed by European powers such as England.  The Monarchy of Spain endeavored to \nretaliate by building an armada of warships that was dubbed \"The Invincible Armada\".  The armada was a collection of over 130 \nnaval warships and transport-ships, which contained approximately 8,000 seamen and 19,000 soldiers.  King Philip II directed \nthis armada to invade England when the various and frequent raids on Spanish commerce in the Caribbean became intolerable.  \nEngland's success in repelling the Spanish fleet saved England and the Netherlands from potential consolidation into the \nSpanish empire, but despite the armadas' defeat, the blow dealt by the Spanish upon England's reputation as the greatest \nEuropean power was palpable.\n^    Thereafter, Spain declined in power quickly; and by the 19th century, Spain became somewhat marginal in international \npolitics.  Spain's period of imperial power and exploration left a legacy that consisted of 18 Latin American states, Puerto \nRico, and the ever-growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States today.  In 1975 Spain transitioned into a \nconstitutional monarchy by way of a democratic constitution and is now recognized for its eclectic culture as well as for \nthe glory and mystique that it once possessed in its youth.\n\n"

They also cannot build $LINK<Spearmen=PRTO_Spearman>.\n^\n^The Sumerians were, by historical consensus, the first human civilization. Originally from Asia Minor, they settled between the \nTigris and Euphrates (in modern-day Iraq) and began to farm and create simple goods. They relied on a sort of theocratic city-state government, \nwhere each Sumerian city worshipped a separate god and had a separate governor, although all paid tribute to a single King in the capital, Ur.\n^    Sumeria's first and greatest accomplishment was the extent to which its people controlled their environment. They drained swamps, dug canals, \nand generally bent the Euphrates region to their needs. They plowed the land for the first time in history, and took advantage of the rich, fertile \nMesopotamia soil. However, the area was low on other resources, so the Sumerian city-states were forced to import goods (particularly metals). Thus they \nhad to create a barter system of trade, as well as riverboats to more easily traverse the rivers that flanked their home. The invention of the plow led in \nturn to the invention of the wheel, which permitted animals to pull carts as well as plow fields, and also to the creation of better pottery (with potters' \nwheels).\n^    Since specialists were now able to create goods, and not every man had to farm, full-time priests could administer community affairs as well as the \ntemples in each city. To support them, in turn, people had time to devise picture signs and other very early alphabets, and being a full-time scribe became a \nviable profession. The literature of Sumeria followed thereafter, culminating in the Epic of {Gilgamesh}, a lengthy poem dedicated to the mythic god-king whose \nreal and legendary exploits blend together. A companion of Gilgamesh, Enkidu, fought by Gilgamesh's side in many battles, and for him the {Enkidu Warriors} are \nnamed: fierce fighters who sought to defend Sumerian lands from the other civilizations being born nearby.\n",
      "description": "#DESC_RACE_Sumeria\n^\n^\n^    The literature of the Sumerians was not limited to stories, though.  In fact, one fact of modern life is still as Sumeria designed it.  The Sumerian priesthood \ndeveloped an early mathematics for commercial and religious purposes, and their number system was based around the number 60.  Thus time itself is divided into units of \n60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and so forth. The 24-hour day also originates with Sumerian calendars, as does the 360-degree circle.  So the fingerprints \nof the world's most ancient civilization are still visible today.\n^    Sumeria's end came gradually, as barbarians saw what they had achieved and strove to emulate it.  About 1,500 years after the first Sumerian cities took form, \nAmorite nomads settled near Ur in a place called Babylon. The resulting civilization grew into a mighty kingdom in its own right, and when Elamite invaders (from modern-day \nIran) sacked Ur, Babylon (which then still styled itself Akkad) saw its opportunity to eclipse its sire. They went in, dispersed the Elamites, and rebuilt Ur in their \nown image. Sumerian culture and language persisted, but slowly assimilated into the new dominant empire. Sumeria disappeared completely as an autonomous culture by 1900 BC.\n\n"

Before they overwhelmed the neighboring tribes under their leader {Shaka} in the early 19th century \nto form an empire, the Zulu were only one of the many patrilineal Nguni clans in the Mtetwa empire. Traditionally \ngrain farmers, the Zulu also kept large herds of cattle on the lightly wooded grasslands, replenishing their herds \nby raiding neighboring tribes. Boys in Shaka's militaristic society were initiated at adolescence in groups called \nage sets. Each age set constituted a unit of the Zulu army and was stationed away from home at royal barracks under \ndirect control of the King. Formed into regiments ({Impi}), these men could marry and leave service only when the \nking gave permission to the age set as a whole. \n^    On the death of the last Mtetwa emperor in 1817, Shaka (1816-28) established his clan's dominance over their \nneighbors and, using a well-disciplined and efficient fighting force, conquered most of the Natal region. During \nthe reign of Shaka's successor, Dingane, Boer settlers, who formed an alliance with Dingane's brother and deposed \nhim in 1840, penetrated the Zulu empire. The empires survived, but under King Mpande (1840-72) portions of Zulu \nterritory were occupied by the Boers and by the British, who moved into Natal in 1838 and annexed it in 1843. \nWar broke out in 1878 when Mpande's successor, Cetshwayo, refused to disband his Impi and to place himself under \nBritish control. Despite stiff resistance, the British defeated the poorly armed Zulu in July 1879, occupied the \nremainder of their country, and divided Zululand into 13 small kingdoms. Zululand was made a British crown colony \nin 1887 under the Native Law of Natal, and bloody Zulu rebellions were put down in 1888 and 1906. By British edict \nin 1894, two-thirds of the Zulu's remaining land was confiscated, and they were confined to native reserves. \nThe incorporation of Zululand into Natal in 1897 ended its separate existence.

The Twelve Tables of Rome, written in 500 BC, and its \nsuccessors such as the Justinian Code, were the first codes of law to distinguish between public law, which involves the state, and private \nlaw, which concerns disputes between citizens. Roman law was the first formalized written system of laws, and went on to influence many \nof the legal systems of the modern world.\n\n\n"

Derived from the concept of monarchy, feudalism was a hierarchical system in which each descending stratum owed allegiance to \nthose above. The king, whose authority was second only to God, granted tracts of land, or fiefs, to his barons. The barons might then grant \nsmaller estates to knights, who swore to protect and serve the baron. The knights, in turn, might then grant fractions of their fiefs to \nsubordinates who would serve the knights. At the bottom of the feudal pyramid were the serfs, who could not own land, and acted essentially \nas slave laborers who worked the land for their masters. Feudalism began to decline in the 13th century, when standing armies and \nmercenaries began to fulfill the protective role once served by the vassals and knights.\n\n\n"

In 1939, based on German experiments that successfully split the uranium atom, physicists were able to explain the process of \nnuclear fission.  When a large, unstable atomic nucleus splits (fissions) it results in two or more smaller, more stable nuclei accompanied by \nthe release of tremendous amounts of energy and lingering, deadly radioactivity. The first application of this powerful technology was in \nwarfare. A top-secret research effort in the U.S. known as the Manhattan Project studied the fission process, and eventually produced the \nfirst atomic bombs, which were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

      "description": "#DESC_TECH_Nuclear_Power\n^\n^\n^In addition to its potential for destruction, the energy released in nuclear fission was seen as a potential source of controlled power generation. \nBy 1944, large-scale nuclear reactors were in operation for the production of plutonium, although the energy produced by these reactors was \nnot used. Following World War II, increased efforts were turned toward the extensive use of nuclear power to produce electricity. Nuclear \npower plants use the radiant energy of a controlled nuclear reaction to heat water, converting it to steam to spin turbines that generate \nelectricity. The major drawback to nuclear fission is the lack of a safe means of disposal for the waste produced by the reaction, which \nretains its lethal radioactivity for hundreds of years. Another hazard is the possibility of a malfunction in the reactor that could lead to a \nmeltdown of the core. Despite massive safety precautions, human error and equipment failures can lead to devastating accidents such as the \nexplosion at Chernobyl in 1986, in which at least 30 people were killed and thousands lost their homes and face possible long-term illness \nafter exposure to near-lethal doses of radiation. Because of growing public concern, the development of new nuclear power plants has \nslowed as scientists search for viable solutions to these problems.\n\n\n"

This tiny satellite orbited the earth for 57 days, providing information on radiation and other phenomena in the upper \natmosphere. In less than a year, the United States had also launched a satellite, Explorer one. This started the \"space race\", years of competition \nbetween the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to achieve new frontiers in space exploration. Space flight advanced rapidly from the simple sub-orbital \nflights of the 1950s, to manned missions to Earth's moon in the late 1960s. The rapid growth of space technology led to many practical \napplications, such as weather and surveillance satellites, and vastly improved worldwide communications. Today, although hindered by severe \ngovernment budget cuts, the exploration of space continues. Plans in the near future call for continued orbital exploration via the space shuttle \nprogram, and the eventual construction of the multi-national, manned space station \"Freedom\" in the early 21st century.\n\n\n"

If one can approach an enemy undetected, the attack has \na better chance of being successful. The widespread use of radar starting in World War II greatly decreased the possibility of surprise for an \nairborne assault. Planes could be detected from miles away, giving the enemy a chance to prepare for the attack. Over the years, the military \nhas employed many different approaches to solve this problem. The most recent development is \"Stealth\" technology. Stealth planes are \npainted with radar-absorbing paint, and designed in such a way as to minimize the number of angular surfaces from which an enemy can \nbounce a radar signal. The engines are also hooded to reduce the plane's heat signature. The result is an aircraft capable of approaching an \nenemy target, launching an attack, and returning to base with little chance of detection. The F-117A Stealth Fighter was used with great \neffectiveness by US forces in the Persian Gulf War in 1991.\n\n\n"

As a result the order became \nfantastically wealthy, as the Grandmasters shrewdly invested the order's wealth, using plunder to buy goods and sell them throughout \nthe Mediterranean.\n^\tKings, however, often become jealous of wealthy organizations over which they have little or no control. The French king \nPhilip IV, his treasury emptied and his debts monstrous from constant warfare, accused the Templars of heresy and blasphemy, and \nconfiscated almost all of their wealth in France. Other monarchs followed suit, embarking on a program of persecution and repression \nwhose goal was mostly to secure the Templars' money for themselves.

Starting in the \n17th century, the monarchs of Europe began to be stripped of their absolute power, and by the end of the 19th century the \ncitizens had a strong voice in government in many European nations. Large populations made public forums impractical, so the \npeople elected groups of representatives to carry their views to the ruling powers. Strictly speaking, this type of system more \nclosely resembles a republican system rather than a true democracy. This type of representative democracy is considered the best \ngoverning system in the modern world because of the personal and economic freedom enjoyed by the citizens.\n\n"

      "description": "#DESC_PRTO_Stealth_Bomber\n^\n^\n^Concurrent with the development of a stealth fighter, aeronautical engineers began to apply stealth technology \nto a full-scale bomber. The B-1B bomber, which went into service in 1986 as a replacement for the B-52, \nincorporated some of these innovations. The radar signature of the B-1B was reduced to a mere one percent that of \nthe B-52 due to its low cross-section and its minimal use of radar-reflective, hard-edged surfaces. Soon after \nthe B-1B entered service, the U.S. Air Force commissioned Northrop to develop a true stealth bomber as an \neventual replacement. First revealed to the public in 1988, the B-2 stealth bomber uses a flying wing design \nsimilar in shape to the F-117A stealth fighter. The flying wing design reduces the profile of the B-2 by \nincorporating its engines into the body of the plane. The engine exhausts and intakes are shielded to prevent \ninfrared tracking. The B-2 also makes use of curved surfaces and radar-absorbing materials to enhance its \n\"invisibility\", and make it far less detectable than the B-1B. As of the late 1980s, it was announced that 132 \nB-2's would be constructed, and would enter service sometime in the 1990s.\n\n\n;   ____________________________________________LEADER / ARMY UNITS_____________________________________________\n\n\n\n"
