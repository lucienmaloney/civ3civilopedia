#GCON_Overpopulation
Overpopulation
^
^
^Depending upon the level of difficulty you choose to play, overpopulation affects your cities at different stages. 
In each city, a number of citizens are born content. Thereafter, the rest are born unhappy. The number born content
are as follows.
^
^
^{Difficulty			Content Citizens}
^* Chieftain					4
^* Warlord					3
^* Regent					2
^* Monarch					2
^* Emperor					1
^* Demigod					1
^* Deity					1

#GCON_Craters
Craters
^
^
^Craters can occur in a non-city square due to bombardment attack. When a bombardment attack which eliminates
the last unit or terrain improvement in a square, a crater may be formed. Like pollution, the presence of
craters reduces a square's production, commerce, and food output by one.
^
^
^{Clearing Craters}  Craters can be cleaned up by $LINK<workers=GCON_Worker_Jobs>.
 


#GCON_Barricades
Barricades
^
^
^When a civilization has learned $LINK<construction=TECH_Construction>, its workers know how to construct
stone and masonry [barricades], which are even more formidable than $LINK<Fortresses=GCON_Fortresses>. 
^
^A Barricades can only be built on a square already containing a Fortress. Even if unoccupied, barricades
automatically stops movement of a ground unit entering its square (unless that unit belongs to the same civilization
currently controlling the barricade's square, or if that unit has a $LINK<Right of Passage=GCON_Agreements>
agreement through that land. Barricades become a fortress if their square is pillaged.
^
^Military units inside barricades have a few advantages.
^* They get a 100% defensive bonus if attacked (i.e., twice the defensive bonus being in a Fortress).
^* The $LINK<zone of control=GCON_ZOC> exerted by the fortress still applies to a barricades.



#GCON_Bombardment_in_Ports
Bombardment in Ports
^
^
^A ship moored at a dock, or at anchor, is unable to quickly maneuver. Therefore, naval units "in port" (i.e., in a
coastal city square being bombarded) are especially vulnerable to bombardment attacks.



#GCON_Collateral_Damage
Collateral Damage
^
^
^An attack by a unit with the “Collateral Damage” capability can potentially damage improvements in the
attacked square during the attack, representing damage to improvements, local structures or residents due
to combat (but not necessarily due to bombardment).



#GCON_Enslavement 
Enslavement
^
^
^Enslavement allows a unit to potentially "enslave" a combatant (instead of killing it) when it wins a battle. A unit with the "enslave" capability has a 1/3 chance of enslaving a defeated unit everytime it wins a battle. As soon as the battle is over, the game determines if the defeated unit is enslaved; if so, the unit is turned into another unit type (as specificed in the editor) and is immediately under the control of the victorious player. 
^
^The $LINK<Privateer=PRTO_Privateer>, the English $LINK<Man-O-War=PRTO_Man-O-War>, and the Mayan
$LINK<Javelin Thrower=PRTO_Javelin_Thrower> have the Enslavement capability. 



#GCON_Landmark_Terrain
Landmark Terrain
^
^
^A pre-designed scenario (only) might feature "Landmark Terrain", which essentially is a variation on a
standard terrain type in order to alter that terrain's shield (production), food or commerce value(s).
If the game preference for [Show Food and Shields on Map] is ON, Landmark Terrain squares are shown on
the game map by a small gold diamond outline. As usual, information about a square's terrain can always be
determined by right-clicking on it.



#GCON_Locked_Alliances
Locked Alliances
^
^
^A pre-designed scenario (only) might begin with some (or all) civilizations grouped into several "Locked
Alliances". Members of a Locked Alliance have a permanent $LINK<Mutual Protection Pact=GCON_Agreements> with
each other. Therefore, a civilization that is part of a Locked Alliance is not allowed to conduct any type
of attack against another member of its alliance. Furthermore, if any civilization attacks another nation
that is part of a Locked Alliance, the attacker will find itself at war with all nations member to that
Locked Alliance.
^
^
^{Permanent War}  
^A Locked Alliance (and all of its member civilizations) might also find itself permanently at war -- right
from the start of the scenario -- with another Locked Alliance if so dictated by the scenario. Such a war is
permanent, and only ends when all members of one of the warring alliances have been eliminated (or the
scenario's time limit is reached).
^
^
^{Coalition Victory}
^A scenario featuring one or more Locked Alliances might specify that "Coalition Victory Conditions" are in effect.
In this case, victory criteria (score, victory points, cultural value, etc.) are summed for all allied players in
each Locked Alliance. As soon as any coalition has fulfilled the scenario's victory conditions the scenario ends
and all civilizations member to the winning coalition are awarded victory. 




#GCON_Volcanic_Eruptions
Volcanic Eruptions
^
^
^A $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano> is a disaster waiting to happen, as it can suddenly erupt with no warning. Most of
the time, however, a dark cloud begins to emanate from the volcano's "mouth" a few turns in advance of an eruption --
but such a warning cannot be guaranteed. Rest assured, however, once you notice a volcano beginning to smolder an
eruption is in the offing.
^
^{Lava Flow}  
^When a volcano erupts it spews forth lava -- in the form of $LINK<pollution=GCON_Pollution> -- that will mar the landscape of many of
the tiles adjacent to the volcanic mountain. Volcanic "fallout" can be cleaned up by $LINK<workers=GCON_Worker_Jobs>
set to clean up damage.



#GCON_Plague
Plague
^
^
^The sudden appearance of The Plague can be a devastating event. Plague, if and when it occurs, can wipe out city population
and land units (except Kings). The effect of plague is exacerbated in larger cities, walled cities and cities
with $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce> and a $LINK<trade network=GCON_Trade>. Once the concept of $LINK<Sanitation=TECH_Sanitation>
is understood the effect of plague is much reduced.



#GCON_Plants
Power Plants
^
^
^Once a city has a $LINK<factory=BLDG_Factory>, it may also build a [Power Plant]. There are four kinds:
^
^$LINK<Coal Plant=BLDG_Coal_Plant>
^Increases factory output by 50%.
^
^
^$LINK<Hydro Plant=BLDG_Hydro_Plant>
^Increases factory output by 50%.
^
^
^$LINK<Nuclear Plant=BLDG_Nuclear_Plant>
^Increases factory output by 100%.
^
^
^$LINK<Solar Plant=BLDG_Solar_Plant>
^Increases factory output by 50%.




#GCON_Revolution
Revolution
^
^
^If your civilization has knowledge of more than one system of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments>,
you can cause a revolution to usher in a [new] system of government.
^
^On the [Domestic Advisor] click the "Government" button to start a revolution.



#GCON_ZOC
Zone of Control
^
^
^Some military units have a [zone of control] that influences the eight squares surrounding the unit.
This represents the unit's ability to project its combat power into surrounding areas. Such units attack
enemies that enter the zone of control without initiating a full battle.
^
^The following military units have a zone of control:
^* $LINK<Aegis Cruisers=PRTO_AEGIS_Cruiser>
^* $LINK<Armies=PRTO_Army>
^* $LINK<Cavalry=PRTO_Cavalry>
^* $LINK<German Panzers=PRTO_Panzer>
^* $LINK<Mechanized Infantry=PRTO_Mech_Infantry>
^* $LINK<Modern Armor=PRTO_Modern_Armor>
^* $LINK<Mongol Keshik=PRTO_Keshik>
^* $LINK<Ottoman Sipahi=PRTO_Sipahi>
^* $LINK<Modern Paratroops=PRTO_Paratrooper>
^* $LINK<Radar Artillery=PRTO_Radar_Artillery>
^* $LINK<Russian Cossacks=PRTO_Cossack>
^* $LINK<Spanish Conquistador=PRTO_Conquistador>
^* $LINK<Tanks=PRTO_Tank>



#GCON_Unit_Support
Supporting Military Units
^
^
^Generally, each military unit must be supported with one gold per turn from its $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>.
However, each form of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> defers these costs for a certain number of units,
depending upon how many towns, cities, or metros the civilization controls.
^
^{Government			Town	City		Metro}
^Anarchy				  0		  0		  0
^Despotism				  4		  4		  4
^Monarchy				  2		  4		  8
^Republic				  1		  3		  4
^Feudalism			  	  5		  2		  1
^Communism			  6		  6		  6
^Fascism				  4		  7		  10
^Democracy			  0		  0		  0




#GCON_Governments
Governments
^
^
^There are eight forms of government that you can use to control your civilization.
Each has advantages and disadvantages. The type of government you use determines:
^
^How efficient your $LINK<workers=PRTO_Worker> are (how quickly they get their jobs done).
^How much $LINK<Corruption and Waste=GCON_Corruption> affects your civilization.
^The number of citizens you can $LINK<draft=GCON_Draft> per turn.
^The number of military units that can be used as $LINK<military police=GCON_Moods>.
^The number of military units you can have before you must $LINK<support=GCON_Unit_Support>
them from your $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>.
^
^The possible government types are:
^* $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy>
^* $LINK<Despotism=GOVT_Despotism>
^* $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy>
^* $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic>
^* $LINK<Feudalism=GOVT_Feudalism>
^* $LINK<Communism=GOVT_Communism>
^* $LINK<Fascism=GOVT_Fascism>
^* $LINK<Democracy=GOVT_Democracy>
^
^
^To change your form of government, you must have a $LINK<revolution=GCON_Revolution>.




#GCON_Mobilization
Mobilization
^
^
^When a civilization develops $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism>, it can [Mobilize] its economy for war.
Mobilize your economy using the "Mobilization" button on the Domestic Advisor.
^
^
^{Effects of Mobilization}
^* During mobilization a city building a military unit produces one extra $LINK<shield=GCON_Shields>
in every square that is already producing at least one.
^A civilization that is mobilized:
^* May only build military units and military city improvements.
^* May not build peacetime improvements.
^* May not return to Normalcy until a Peace Treaty is signed.
^
^
^During Mobilization workers, settlers and explorers can be built, but will not receive the production bonus. 



#GCON_Barbarians
Barbarians
^
^
^[Barbarian tribes] inhabit every continent of the world and there are two types: Passive and Aggressive.
^
^
^{Passive Tribes} 
^Passive barbarians reside in small villages. When you send a unit into one of these villages, several
things can happen -- some good and some bad. Possible results range from learning a new Civilization Advance 
to enraging the residents and having to battle them.
^
^
^{Aggressive Tribes}
^These [named] tribes also reside in villages on the map, but they send out raiding parties
to fight your units and pillage your cities and towns. By destroying a tribal village you can stop the raids from
that village. But the survivors will move to a new site in explored or unexplored $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory>
and begin raiding from there.



#GCON_Strengths
Civilization Strengths
^
^
^There are eight areas in which civilizations have natural [strengths.] Each strength gives a civilization one free
Advance and one rules advantage as outlined below:
^
^
^{Agricultural}
^Agricultural city improvements (aqueduct, for instance) are easier to build, and the center city square
and irrigated deserts produce one more food.
^
^
^{Commercial}													
^The center city squares of all cities and metros produce extra $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and less
$LINK<corruption=GCON_Corruption> is experienced.
^
^
^{Expansionist}												
^The civilization starts the game with a $LINK<scout=PRTO_Scout> and can build more later, and passive minor
$LINK<barbarians=GCON_Barbarians> are friendlier.
^
^
^{Industrious}										
^Workers complete $LINK<tasks=GCON_Worker_Jobs> faster and the center city square of all cities produces
extra $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields> in cities and metros.
^
^
^{Militaristic}													
^It is easier to build military improvements (barracks, for example), and combat $LINK<experience=GCON_Experience>
is gained more quickly.
^
^
^
^(continued)
#DESC_GCON_Strengths
^
^
^{Religious}													
^Religious civilizations do not experience prolonged periods of $LINK<anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy> during $LINK<revolutions=GCON_Revolution>, and
religious city improvements (Temples, for instance) are easier to build.
^
^
^{Scientific}												
^Scientific city improvements (like research labs) are easier to build and the civilization
receives a free $LINK<Civilization Advance=MENU_Technologies> at the start of every era.
^
^
^{Seafaring}
^Each city built along the coast receives a commerce bonus in the center city square, and Seafaring city
improvements (such as the Harbor or Commercial Dock) are easier to build.  Ships move faster and are less likely to sink in the sea or ocean.




#GCON_Draft
Draft
^
^ 
^When a civilization develops $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism> its citizens can be drafted into
military service. Each city can draft some of its population each turn, depending upon the government currently in effect.
^* A civilization in $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy> may not use the draft.
^* A city in a $LINK<Democracy=GOVT_Democracy> or $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic> can draft [one] citizen per turn.
^* A city in a country under $LINK<Communism=GOVT_Communism>, $LINK<Despotism=GOVT_Despotism>, $LINK<Fascism=GOVT_Fascism>,  $LINK<Feudalism=GOVT_Feudalism>, or $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy> can draft [two] citizens per turn.
^
^To utilize the draft, press the "Draft" button on the City Display. You may only draft citizens from a city with
^a population of 7 or higher.
^
^The draft produces the following $LINK<conscript=GCON_Experience> units, depending upon your level of 
scientific development:
^
^$LINK<Spearman=PRTO_Spearman>
^$LINK<Pikeman=PRTO_Pikeman>
^$LINK<Musketman=PRTO_Musketman>
^$LINK<Rifleman=PRTO_Rifleman>
^$LINK<Infantry=PRTO_Infantry>
^$LINK<Mech. Infantry=PRTO_Mech_Infantry>
^
^However, drafting citizens will cause unhappiness in the city.



#GCON_Maintenance
Maintenance
^
^
^Some city improvements must be maintained after they are built. This [maintenance] cost
is paid from your $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury> once every turn.

#GCON_Combat
Combat
^
^
^There are four types of combat: ground/naval combat, bombardment, missile attacks, and air combat.
^[Ground/Naval combat] occurs when units of different civilizations try to occupy the same square.
The two units trade blows until one of them loses its health bar and is destroyed.
The winner may be damaged (its health bar is reduced). 
^[Bombardment] occurs when a ranged unit or air unit attacks without entering the defender's square.
Bombardment inflicts losses to the defender's health bar but never completely destroys them.
Air bombardment is the same except the planes fly to the target and may be shot down on the way.
^[Missile attacks] are like bombardment, but the unit never returns to its base and the attacks can destroy enemy units.
^[Air combat] occurs between air units.
^
^{Repairing Damage}
^A unit that takes damage in combat but survives can heal, adding one $LINK<block=GCON_Experience> per turn back to
its health bar. To do so, it
^* must be in friendly or neutral territory.
^* must not move for a complete turn.
^
^{Repairing Faster}
^A city with a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks> heals ground units completely in one turn.
^A city with a $LINK<harbor=BLDG_Harbor> heals sea units completely in one turn.
^A city with an $LINK<airport=BLDG_Airport> heals air units completely in one turn.
^A civilization with $LINK<Battlefield Medicine=BLDG_Battlefield_Medicine> heals in enemy territory.



#GCON_Conversion
City Defection
^
^
^Cities with little culture who are members of culturally-poor civilizations can [defect]
to other, stronger, more impressive civilizations. This can occur when the city is located close
to a culturally rich rival civilization or when foreign nationals are still present in the city.
^
^
^Defections are made more likely by:
^* The presence of $LINK<foreign nationals=GCON_Nationality> of the other civilization in the city.
^* The application of $LINK<propaganda=GCON_Espionage> by the other civilization.
^* $LINK<Civil disorder=GCON_Disorder> in the city.
^* The proximity of foreign territory.
^* The proximity of a foreign capital.
^
^Defections are made less likely by:
^* The presence of ground combat units in the city.
^* We Love The ____ Day.
^* The proximity of your capital.



#GCON_Air_Missions
Air Missions
^
^
^Air units are not moved around the map like other units. Instead, they are stationed in a city,
and assigned missions which they execute immediately against targets within their operational range.
^
^When an air unit is active, choose the mission you want it to perform (command button or hot key) and
choose a target within the plane's range.
^
^{Air Superiority (S)}
^The plane attempts to intercept enemy aircraft that attack targets within the inner half of its operational range.
^
^{Bombing Mission (B)}
^The plane flies to the target and attacks, sometimes affecting city improvements,
and sometimes population.
^
^{Precision Strike (P)}
^Performed by $LINK<stealth aircraft=PRTO_Stealth_Fighter>,
precision strikes destroy city improvements only, unless there are none in which case population is affected.
^
^{Recon Mission (R)}
^The plane flies to the target and reveals the map.
^
^{Re-Base Mission (Ctrl-R)}
^The unit can be moved to another city or a $LINK<carrier=PRTO_Carrier> a distance equal to up to Six
times the plane's operational range.



#GCON_Transport
Transport
^
^
^Some naval and one air unit can carry or [transport] other units.
^
^{Ships}
^Ships can be boarded from any shoreline
by simply moving the rider onto the ship. They may also be boarded from inside a coastal city by right-clicking
the unit in the garrison box and selecting from the menu, or using the Load command button when on the main map.
^
^{Helicopters}
^Helicopters are the only air unit that can [transport] ground units, and they may only be foot soldiers.
To board a helicopter a ground unit must start its turn in a city with the chopper and use the Load command button.



#GCON_Espionage
Espionage
^
^
^Once a civilization learns $LINK<Espionage=TECH_Espionage> and builds an $LINK<Intelligence Agency=BLDG_Intelligence_Center>,
it can conduct [espionage missions] to find out classified information about other civilizations, friend and foe.
Espionage can also be used to harm a rival or sabotage his $LINK<production=GCON_Shields>.
Remember though, failed missions can seriously damage your reputation.
^
^{Espionage Screen:}
^
^The Espionage screen is comprised of: current opponents, available missions, your current asset information, city selection, 
and operational cost options. This screen is available for use once a player has discovered $LINK<Writing=TECH_Writing>.
^
^Your opponents are displayed followed by icons that indicate your Espionage status within that civilization. If the Embassy Icon 
is displayed, you currently have an embassy within that civilization's capitol city. If the Spy icon is present, you have a spy
planted within that civilization.
^
^The mission area displays the various diplomatic and clandestine espionage options which you may currently engage in. 
When an espionage mission button has been selected. The following is a list of espionage and diplomatic missions that may be performed:
^
^The assets section provides a summary of your current monetary and technological assets, including the amount of gold in your
treasury, your technological achievements (those that apply to espionage), and your level of spy experience
^
^The operational cost options allow you to set the level of risk you are willing to undertake with regard to the current mission. 
The controls for executing and canceling missions are also located in this area.

#GCON_Spaceship
Space Ship
^
^To win the space race $LINK<victory=GCON_Victory>, you have to be the first to build, then launch, the spaceship.

^
^The components may be built in any order.




#GCON_Victory
Victory Conditions
^
^To check your current level of victory at any time during play, press the {F8} key to open the Victory Status Screen,
or press the {V} button located in the lower right corner of the screen. 
^ 
^There are six basic ways to win:
^
^{Space Race}
^One of the peaceful methods of victory in [Civilization III] is to be the first to colonize Alpha Centauri, the nearest star 
system. In order to achieve this victory, the player must be the first to launch a completed $LINK<spaceship=GCON_Spaceship> 
to Alpha Centauri.
^
^[Building the Ship]
^Each civilization can build an "Alpha Centauri-worthy" spacecraft, and construction can begin when
the civilization completes the $LINK<Apollo Program=BLDG_Apollo_Project> (Small Wonder).
The ship is comprised of [ten] components, which must be built prior to launch.
^
^
^{Domination}
^Have 70% of the world's land surface within your $LINK<borders=GCON_Territory> as well as 70% of the world's population
within your cities.
This can be accomplished either by military measures or by $LINK<cultural=GCON_Culture> development
(or, more likely, a combination of the two).
^
^
^{Conquest}
^A purely military solution: conquer the world, civilization by civilization. If you eliminate [all]
civilizations from the game, you win.
^
^
^{Cultural Victory}
^Make one of your cities or your whole civilization the envy of the world. A single city with 20,000
culture points will satisfy this victory condition. For your overall culture to do so, a variable
number of
#DESC_GCON_Victory
^
^
^total culture points is needed, based on map size:
^
^Tiny: 60,000
^Small: 80,000
^Standard: 100,000
^Large: 130,000
^Huge: 160,000
^
^{Diplomacy}
^Getting yourself elected to the head of the United Nations requires excellent diplomatic skills.
After the $LINK<United Nations=BLDG_United_Nations> is built, there
are periodic votes by the council to elect a Leader. To be elected, a candidate must win a majority of all votes.
If you are the one, you win the game.
^
^[Candidates]
^There are always two, and sometimes three, candidates. To be a candidate in an election a civilization must, either:
^	* have built the UN.
^	* control at least 25% of the world's territory.
^	* control at least 25% of the world's population.
^
^If only one civilization is eligible, then the second candidate is the civilization with the largest population.
^
^{Histograph}
^[Civilization III] runs until the year 2050. If the game ends and no one has won the space race, conquered or dominated
the world, wowed the world with cultural achievements or diplomatic aplomb, 
then the winner is determined by constructing a [histograph.]
^
^A histograph looks at the total "Score" generated by all civilizations turn by turn over the course of the game.
The civilization that generated the highest score -- on average -- wins. Being powerful in Ancient Times
is just as valuable as being powerful in the Modern Era.




#GCON_Maps
Maps
^
^
^{Fog of Intelligence}
^The map is overlaid with a veil of darkness obscuring areas of the world your people have never explored.
As units move over the surface of the world they reveal the unexplored areas, brightening the areas they
can currently "see." Areas that have been explored, but are not currently "seen" by your people have a soft gray
veil over them.
^
^So at any time, each and every square of the map is either
^* unexplored			in darkness
^* explored				in grayness
^* seen				well lit
^
^
^{World Maps} As civilizations explore the world and found new cities, they gather information and create a map of
the world that is unique. For each civilization, it is comprised of the area its people currently see
and the explored areas (as they were when last seen). This is called the civilization's [world map] and
can be very valuable in negotiations with other, less knowledgeable, civilizations. You will be able to trade world
maps after your civilization discovers $LINK<Navigation=TECH_Navigation>.
^
^
^{Territory Maps} Each civilization also keeps a [territory map] showing areas under its cultural influence only.
These are less valuable in negotiations, but still of some worth.




#GCON_Golden_Age
Golden Age
^
^
^Every civilization can experience a [Golden Age], a 20-turn period in which every citizen laborer in the empire
is more productive, producing one extra $LINK<shield=GCON_Shields> and/or $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>
if already producing at least one. A civilization's Golden Age is triggered in one of two ways:
^
^{Unique Unit Victory}
^Each civilization has a unique military unit -- one that only it can build.
A civilization's Golden Age can begin when its unique military unit is victorious in battle.  Note that only victories
versus other civilizations are capable of initiating a Golden Age in this way.  Victories versus barbarians will not initiate
a Golden Age.
^
^
^{Great Wonders}
^Each $LINK<Great Wonder=MENU_Wonders> is associated with one or more civilization strengths.
If a civilization builds a Great Wonder (or Wonders) that corresponds to [both] its unique $LINK<strengths=GCON_Strengths>, its Golden Age can be triggered.
^
^{For example} if the Egyptians (industrious and religious) build the Pyramids (which is both a
feat of construction and a place of worship), Egypt's Golden Age could begin. Or if the
Babylonians (scientific and religious) build the Great Library (scientific) [and] the Oracle
(religious) Babylon's Golden Age could begin.




#GCON_Age_of_Science
Age of Science
^
^
^Every civilization can experience an [Age of Science], a 20-turn period in which the 
$LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research> of each city in that civilization's empire is 25% more productive.
An Age of Science can only be triggered by a $LINK<scientific leader=GCON_Leaders>.




#GCON_Radius
City Radius
^
^
^Every city has a [city radius], an area around the city in which its citizens work. The radius is shown on
the City Display and potential radii are shown whenever a settler is active.
^
^{A square is part of a city's radius if it is}
^* within the city's $LINK<cultural borders=GCON_Territory>, and
^* within two squares of the city. 
^
^Citizens of the city work the squares in the city radius, extracting $LINK<Food=GCON_Food>,
$LINK<Shields=GCON_Shields>, and $LINK<Commerce=GCON_Commerce> -- the three basic currencies.





#GCON_Disease
Disease
^
^
^[Disease] kills citizens and units that spend too much time in unhealthy areas like
$LINK<floodplains=TERR_Flood_Plain>, $LINK<jungles=TERR_Jungle> and
$LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh>. Military units that fortify in these terrains are susceptible
to [disease].
^
^Your workers can $LINK<clear jungles or marsh=TFRM_Clear_Wetlands> and eliminate that risk.
Floodplains continue to be risky until you discover $LINK<sanitation=TECH_Sanitation>.




#GCON_Agreements
Diplomatic Agreements
^
^
^When your civilization builds an $LINK<embassy=GCON_Embassies> in a rival's capital city, or when a rival builds one
in your capital, you can negotiate [Diplomatic Agreements] with that civilization. There are four kinds:
^
^
^{Military Alliance}
^You agree to declare war on a despised third party.
^
^
^{Right of Passage}
^You agree to allow his or her military units to move through your $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory> and use
your transportation network (roads and railroads).
^
^
^{Trade Embargo}
^An agreement that neither of you will $LINK<trade=GCON_Trade> with or [allow] trade with a third party.
^
^
^{Mutual Protection Pact}
^An agreement to declare war upon any civilization that attacks your partner.
^
^
^There is a fifth item that you can trade through your Embassies: {Communications}. These are
introductions to a third civilization you can grant or receive from a rival.




#GCON_Culture
Culture
^
^
^[Culture] represents the impact of your civilization's customs, arts, and philosophy on the people
in the countryside surrounding your cities, and is represented in the game by $LINK<borders=GCON_Territory>.
^ 
^
^{City Cultural Value and Borders}
^All Wonders of the World and many city improvements generate culture points every turn. These accumulate
over time and when the total culture value of a city reaches certain thresholds (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000, etc.),
a [border expansion] is triggered. Pay attention to the culture box on the [City Display] to judge
when expansions will occur. The amount of culture each Wonder or improvement contributes doubles after 1000
years.
^ 
^
^{Civilization Culture Value}
^The sum of the cultural values of all of your cities is your [civilization's cultural value.]
It comes into play when you conquer an enemy city (and $LINK<resistance=GCON_Resistance> is determined),
conduct diplomacy with a rival, or when you and a rival both have a legitimate claim on a terrain square.
In all cases, if your civilization is more valuable culturally than your rival, that's good --
and the greater the discrepancy between you, the better.
^ 
^
^{Global Cultures}
^There are five global cultures in the game: Amerindian, Greco-Roman, European, Far Eastern,
and Middle Eastern. Global culture determines the look of cities and citizens, and nations
of the same global culture tend to start near each other and are more tolerant in diplomacy.





#GCON_Nationality
Nationality
^
^
^Each civilization produces citizens of its own [nationality], a characteristic that
persists until $LINK<assimilated=GCON_Assimilation> into another nationality.
^
^ 
^{Foreign Nationals}
^When a city is captured, this can create a city controlled by one nationality, but populated by another.
These citizens are called [foreign nationals]. Foreign nationals retain their team colors so they can be easily identified.
^
^
^Having a city with foreign nationals is not a problem unless you are at war with
the nation that originally produced them. When at war, foreign nationals become
unhappy more quickly than others and are more likely to be affected by hostile propaganda from
their mother country.
^ 
^
^Captured workers and settlers retain their original nationality as well, and, if ordered to
join a city, become foreign nationals within that city.





#GCON_Resistance
Resistance
^
^
^[Resistance] represents the unwillingness of the citizens of a strong culture to be subjugated by
another, less valuable culture. When a city is captured, a comparison of the 
$LINK<civilization cultural values=GCON_Culture> of the two civilizations determines if any of the
$LINK<foreign nationals=GCON_Nationality> will resist.
^
^Resisters are unwilling to work under the new regime.
^ 
^{Stopping Resistance}
^Resisters can be quelled by ending the war or garrisoning strong military units in the city -- the more the better.





#GCON_Assimilation
Assimilation
^
^
^[Assimilation] is the process by which $LINK<foreign nationals=GCON_Nationality> change their nationality
from one civilization to another. When a foreign national has been a part of a minority population longer than not,
he or she assimilates and becomes a member of the majority nationality.
^ 
^
^This process can take many turns, but the reduced risk of successful $LINK<hostile propaganda=GCON_Espionage> makes
it useful.





#GCON_Territory	
Territory
^
^
^Every civilization has [territory] (areas of the map claimed as national land). The extent of your territory
is the sum of all terrain squares under the cultural influence of your cities, which in turn is a
result of the $LINK<cultural value=GCON_Culture> of each city. 
^
^
^{Borders}
^Your territory is defined by your [borders], which are drawn in your civilization's color, and clearly mark
your cultural boundaries. The area within your borders is [friendly] territory.
^ 
^
^{Advantages of Friendly Territory}
^Your territory has several characteristics beneficial to you.
^* Rival civilizations cannot benefit from the roads or rails within your territory without a
$LINK<right of passage=GCON_Agreements> agreement.
^* You can always $LINK<"see"=GCON_Maps> squares in friendly territory.
^* Tradable $LINK<resources=GCON_ResourcesN> are easier to get when found within your territory
(no need for a $LINK<colony=GCON_Colony>).
^* You can eject rival military units from your territory during diplomatic negotiations.





#GCON_Colony
Colony
^
^
^[Colonies] are built and maintained by a worker and enable exploitation of tradable $LINK<resources=GCON_ResourcesN>
that lie outside your $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory>. As with all tradable resources (strategic and luxury),
you need a road connecting the colony to one of your cities to get the benefits of the resource.





#GCON_Trade
Trade and Trade routes
^
^ 
^{Domestic Trade}
^Domestic trade occurs automatically between cities of the same civilization that are [connected] to each other.
Any tradable $LINK<resource=GCON_ResourcesN> within your territory that is connected to any city is shared
by [all] connected cities. Every city that is connected to a resource has that resource in the appropriate box of the
City Display.
^ 
^
^{Foreign Trade}
^A single resource icon is enough to supply the needs of an entire civilization. Excess resources may
be traded to other civilizations if the capital cities of both civilizations are connected. You trade
strategic and luxury resources with other civilizations during diplomatic negotiations.
^
^
^{Trade Route Connections}
Two cities are connected if any one of the following are true:
^* there is a $LINK<road=GCON_Worker_Jobs> or $LINK<railroad=GCON_Worker_Jobs> running between them,
^* there are $LINK<harbors=BLDG_Harbor> in both cities and a visible water route between them,
^* or both cities contain an $LINK<airport=BLDG_Airport>.
^
^
^[Water Routes]: In order to use a water trade route, your civilization must be able to safely traverse
^every square of the route and this depends upon having
$LINK<Map Making=TECH_Map_Making>,
$LINK<Navigation=TECH_Navigation>, and/or
$LINK<Magnetism=TECH_Magnetism>.
^
^
^The only exception involves enemy territory: two cities are not connected if the only road/rail that
connects them passes through enemy territory, or if a harbor is blockaded by enemy naval forces.






#GCON_ResourcesN
Natural Resources
^
^
^There are 27 [natural resources] represented by various icons scattered around the world. These fall into three
categories, [Bonus, Luxury,] and [Strategic].
^
^
^[$LINK<Bonus Resources=GCON_ResourcesB>] give city production bonuses in worked squares within a city radius. Bonus resources
cannot be traded to other cities or civilizations. Bonus resources are always visible in $LINK<explored=GCON_Maps> areas of the map. 
^
^
^[$LINK<Luxury Resources=GCON_ResourcesL>] also give city production bonuses in squares worked by citizens.
But they may also be traded along trade routes, and make content people happy in cities that receive them. Luxury
resources are always visible on the map in explored areas.
^
^
^[$LINK<Strategic Resources=GCON_ResourcesS>], like both the others, give bonuses to city production, but, like luxuries they can also be traded.
Strategic resources are required for a city to build various military units and city improvements. Strategic resources 
appear on the map when a Civilization Advance exposes their usefulness.
^
^
^Luxury and Strategic Resources are referred to as {Tradable Resources.}





#GCON_ResourcesB
Bonus Resources
^
^
^[Bonus resources] are one of the types of $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN>. These
cannot be traded like $LINK<luxury=GCON_ResourcesL> or $LINK<strategic resources=GCON_ResourcesS>,
but do provide bonuses to worked squares within a $LINK<city radius=GCON_Radius>.
^
^
^{City Production Bonuses}
^A citizen laborer working a bonus resource square gains extra $LINK<food=GCON_Food>,
$LINK<shields=GCON_Shields>, and/or $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>.

#GCON_Experience
Combat Experience
^
^
^Military units are rated according to combat experience: [conscripts, regulars, veterans,] and [elite units].
The more experienced a unit, the more damage it can absorb before being destroyed in combat.
The number of blocks in the unit's health bar shows this distinction.
^
^{Unit Type		   Blocks}

^Regulars				3
^Veterans				4
^Elite units				5
^
^
^Normally, cities produce regulars. But if a city has a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks>, it produces [veterans].
Occasionally your men will discover barbarian tribes that contribute [conscripts] to your army, and sometimes you
may institute the draft, which also produces conscripts.
^
^
^[Elite units] cannot be built: they gain this status only through actual combat experience. An elite unit can produce a
$LINK<great leader=GCON_Leaders>, if it continues to be successful.
^
^
^{Battlefield Promotions}
^When one of your units is victorious in battle, there is a chance it will gain combat experience and be promoted to
the next level.





#GCON_Leaders
Leaders
^
^
^There are two kinds of great leaders: Military and Scientific.
^
^A {Military leader} is born in combat. This [can] occur when an $LINK<elite unit=GCON_Experience> wins a
battle. 
^
^A Military Leader can be used to either create an $LINK<army=PRTO_Army> or to
$LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> production of an Improvement or Small Wonder in a city. When a military
leader does either of these actions he disappears.
^
^
^A {Scientific leader} comes about as a result of $LINK<research=GCON_Research>. Each time a technology
is researched for the [first] time by any civilization there is a chance that a Scientific leader will arise
(this chance is increased slightly if the researching civilization has the "scientific"
$LINK<strength=GCON_Strengths>.
^
^A Scientific Leader can be used to increase the scientific output of all cities of his civilization, thus
starting an $LINK<Age of Science=GCON_Age_of_Science>. Simply move the scientific leader to your capital and
press the "Increase Scientific Output" button. A Scientific leader can also be used to
$LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> the construction of any [improvement] (including a Great Wonder) of the city
he's currently in. When the leader does either of these actions he disappears.




#GCON_Armies
Armies
^
^
^An Army is actually a group of ordinary units that move and fight together. To form an army, you must build the Army unit
and then 'load' other units into it. You can load up to three units, though the $LINK<Pentagon=BLDG_Pentagon>
increases this limit to four, if you have built it.
^
^
^{Building an Army}
^Armies can be built in cities that have the $LINK<Military Academy=BLDG_Military_Academy>
or a $LINK<Leader=GCON_Leaders> in them. But you must have at least four cities for every army you create.
^
^{In Battle}
^An army uses one, some, or all its internal units to fight a battle, depending upon the course of the fight.
^
^{Spotting}
^An army can "see" up to two squares away, due to its intrinsic scouts.




#GCON_Hurry_Production
Hurry Production
^
^
^City construction projects (improvements or units) can be hurried to completion if necessary. 
Use the "Hurry" button on the [City Display].
^
^
^Under $LINK<Despotism=GOVT_Despotism>, $LINK<Communism=GOVT_Communism>, $LINK<Feudalism=GOVT_Feudalism>, or $LINK<Fascism=GOVT_Fascism> you hurry production in your cities
by forced labor. Disillusioned by your harsh rule, citizens will leave your city if you institute this type of
rushed production. 
^
^
^Under $LINK<Monarchy=GOVT_Monarchy>, $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic>, and $LINK<Democracy=GOVT_Democracy> you can pay
overtime and hire temporary workers to complete a project. This costs gold from your treasury; the amount depends
upon how much work remains to be done.
^
^
^$LINK<Great leaders=GCON_Leaders> can also be used to hurry production.
^
^
^You have [no] production if your civilization is in $LINK<Anarchy=GOVT_Anarchy>.





#GCON_Corruption
Corruption and Waste
^
^
^[Corruption] is income lost to theft, embezzlement, and other illegal practices. [Waste] is shield production
lost to inefficiency. If left unchecked, corruption and waste will significantly slow the development of your
civilization. You can track the status of corruption and waste in your empire on the
[City Display] and [Domestic Advisor].
^
^
^{Causes}
^In general, the farther a city is from its capital city, the more corruption and waste it experiences. Also the more cities
in your empire, the higher rates of both, overall. Finally, the extent of corruption and waste is also affected by
the system of $LINK<government=MENU_Governments> you are currently using.
^
^
^{Solutions}
^A $LINK<courthouse=BLDG_Courthouse>, $LINK<police station=BLDG_Police_Station>, using Police Officers, or a nearby $LINK<Forbidden Palace=BLDG_Forbidden_Palace> and $LINK<Secret Police HQ=BLDG_Secret_Police_HQ>
reduces corruption.
^
^Another solution, is to change your system of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments>. The more liberal the
government, the less corruption and waste you experience.
^
^Being attached to your capital via road, harbor, or airport also reduces corruption and waste.
^
^$LINK<We Love The ____ Day=GCON_We_Love_The_King_Day> also reduces waste.





#GCON_Pollution
Pollution
^
^
^Pollution is a problem usually associated with the Industrial Age. It is caused by certain city improvements, the meltdown of a $LINK<Nuclear Plant=BLDG_Nuclear_Plant>, $LINK<volcanic eruptions=GCON_Volcanic_Eruptions>, nuclear
explosions, and large city populations.
^
^
^{Global Warming}
^If world pollution reaches sufficiently critical levels, there is a chance that global warming will occur.
It can cause forests and jungles to disappear, and grasslands to become plains, and plains to become desert.
World pollution is the sum of all city pollution, nuclear explosions, and meltdowns.
^
^
^Polluted areas can be cleaned up by $LINK<workers=GCON_Worker_Jobs>, and pollution from cities can be lessened by
building the $LINK<Mass Transit System=BLDG_Mass_Transit_System> and the $LINK<Recycling Center=BLDG_Recycling_Center>.





#GCON_Embassies
Embassies
^
^
^When a civilization learns $LINK<Writing=TECH_Writing>, it can begin to build its intelligence network.
The first step is to build [embassies] in rival capital cities. That done, you can sign Right of Passage
$LINK<agreements=GCON_Agreements> and Military Alliances against third parties.
^
^When your empire has developed a sense of $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism>,
you can engage in $LINK<Mutual Protection Pacts=GCON_Agreements> and Trade Embargoes against third parties.
^
^Embassies cost gold from your treasury to build, and diplomatic missions cost gold to execute.
^
^Build an embassy by double-clicking the capital city icon after you have learned Writing.

^
^{What Makes 'em Glad?}
^To combat unhappiness in your cities you can build improvements or take actions that produce
happy or content $LINK<faces=GCON_Happy_Faces>. Each happy face changes the mood of one citizen from content to happy; each
content face alters a citizen from unhappy to content.
^
^* Build a $LINK<temple=BLDG_Temple>, $LINK<colosseum=BLDG_Colosseum>, or $LINK<cathedral=BLDG_Cathedral>.
^* Bring assorted $LINK<luxuries=GCON_ResourcesL> into the city.
^* Convert some citizens to $LINK<entertainers=GCON_Specialists>.

^A city in which more people are unhappy than happy falls into $LINK<civil disorder=GCON_Disorder>.
Content citizens and specialists are ignored.



#GCON_War_Weariness
War Weariness
^
^
^During times of war, citizens living under a $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic>, $LINK<Feudalism=GOVT_Feudalism>, or $LINK<Democracy=GOVT_Democracy> become [war weary] and $LINK<unhappy=GCON_Moods> as a result.
^
^When [you] initiate the conflict your people will tolerate it for a while, but then may become quite unhappy.
When someone else declares the war, especially a traditional enemy, your people are more forgiving.
Carrying on a defensive war, that is keeping your troops at home, is more tolerable than offensive campaigns.
^
^The only way to end [war weariness] is to stop the war. You can use all your normal tricks to
$LINK<make 'em happier=GCON_Moods>, but the war weariness remains until the war stops.



#GCON_We_Love_The_King_Day
We Love the __ Day
^
^
^At certain points in the game, if the population of a city has been well provided for and are happy, a city-wide
celebration will occur in that city, called "We Love the King Day" (or Emperor, or Regent, or President, etc.).
^
^The provisions for this to occur are:
^
^	The city cannot be starving,
^	The city cannot have any resisters,
^	The city cannot have any unhappy citizens,
^	There must be more happy citizens than content citizens, and
^	The city must be large enough (typically size 6).
^
^
^
^The benefits of having a "We Love the __ Day" celebration are:
^
^	The chance of the city converting to another civ is halved,
^	Waste in the city is reduced, and
^	The effectiveness of enemy spy propaganda missions against the city is reduced.



#GCON_Research
Scientific Research
^
^
^Your civilization is constantly striving to learn about the world, science, invention, and creativity.
Its ability to succeed at these pursuits depends in large measure upon your allocation of revenue to science.
You set the allocation on the [Domestic Advisor] by sliding the science slider left or right to decrease
or increase (respectively) the amount of your tax revenue that you divert into research. By doing this,
you determine the percentage of each city's income that will be poured into research.
^
^At the start of each turn, the science output of each city is added to the research project currently
in progress, eventually resulting in the discovery of a new $LINK<Civilization Advance=MENU_Technologies>.
^
^To increase the science production in only one city, you can convert a citizen or two to a $LINK<scientist=GCON_Specialists>.
^
^Finally, the science output of individual cities -- and the empire overall, in some cases --
can be dramatically increased by building some improvements and wonders in those cities, such as:
^	$LINK<Copernicus' Observatory=BLDG_Solar_System>
^	$LINK<Libraries=BLDG_Library>
^	$LINK<Newton's University=BLDG_Great_University>
^	$LINK<Research Labs=BLDG_Lab>
^	$LINK<SETI Program=BLDG_SETI_Program>
^	$LINK<Universities=BLDG_University>


#GCON_Food
Food
^
^
^[Every citizen must eat two food per turn or die.] Luckily, most citizens labor in
the areas around their city, yielding some combination of food, $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields>,
and $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and feeding themselves in the process.
^   In some cases, a citizen produces more food than he needs and the excess is put into
his city's food storage box each turn. When it is full, the storage is emptied and the city grows, adding
one citizen to its population.
^   In other cases, a city does not grow enough food to sustain its population, so food
is drawn out of the storage box to make up the shortfall. If a city cannot feed its
population either from new production or stored food, one of its citizens {starves} and disappears.
^   Food production fundamentally depends upon the terrain within the city radius, because citizens
laboring there produce food. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
^
^{A citizen working			Produces this much food}
^Floodplains				3	4 if irrigated.
^Grasslands					2	3 if irrigated.
^Plains						1	2 if irrigated.
^Hills						1	cannot be irrigated.
^Forests					1	cannot be irrigated.
^Marsh						1	cannot be irrigated.
^Coastal					1	cannot be irrigated.
^Sea						1	cannot be irrigated.
^Jungle						1	cannot be irrigated.
^Tundra					1	cannot be irrigated.
^Fresh Water Lake			2	cannot be irrigated.
^Desert					0	1 if irrigated.
^Mountain					0	cannot be irrigated
^Volcano					0	cannot be irrigated.
^Note that some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus food as well.



#GCON_Shields
Production and Shields
^
^
^[Shields] represent [common] raw materials in the countryside [and] the labor
required to make useful materials from them. In essence they are a measure of [production].
^   The shields a city produces are used to complete its current project, which may be to build a military unit,
city improvement, or wonder. When the production box is full of shields, the project is finished,
the box is emptied, and a new project must be started.
^   Some cities lose shields to $LINK<waste=GCON_Corruption>.
^   Shield production depends upon the terrain within the city's radius, because citizens
laboring there produce shields. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
^
^{A citizen working		Produces this many shields}
^Grasslands				0	1 if mined.
^Outcropping			1	2 if mined.
^Plains					1	2 if mined.
^Hills					1	3 if mined.
^Mountains				1	3 if mined.
^Tundra				0	1 if mined.
^Desert				1	2 if mined.
^Forest				2	cannot be mined.
^Marsh					0	cannot be mined.
^Volcano				0	cannot be mined.
^
^Note that some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus shields as well.



#GCON_Commerce
Commerce
^
^
^Commerce is the exchange of goods and cash between communities within and around a city, the exchange of
knowledge and ideas, travel and shopping. It is the commercial exploitation of goods and services within your society.
^
^Commerce production depends upon the terrain within the city's radius, because citizens
laboring there produce commerce. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
^
^{A citizen working			Produces}
^Floodplains				1	2 with road.
^Grasslands					0	1 with road.
^Plains						0	1 with road.
^Hills						0	1 with road.
^Mountains					0	1 with road.
^Forests					0	1 with road.
^Jungles					0	1 with road.
^Marsh						0	1 with road.
^
^Note any square next to a river produces one extra commerce per turn, and 
some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus commerce as well.
^
^
^The government derives {Tax Revenue} from commercial activity and divides the revenue into three areas,
^* The build-up of liquid wealth in the $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>,
^* Long-term investment in $LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research>, or
^* The entertainment of the population to produce $LINK<happy faces=GCON_Happy_Faces>.
^
^The allocation of tax revenues into these three categories is set using the Revenue Slider on the [Domestic Advisor].



#GCON_Treasury
Treasury
^
^
^The [treasury] is where your empire's wealth is stored. Each turn, the net income from each of your cities is combined,
costs are deducted, and the remainder is placed into your treasury. On some turns, gold may have to be drawn out of the
treasury to cover costs. Balancing your need to spend with your need to build a substantial store of liquid wealth is
an interesting challenge.
^
^{Gold}
^You use gold from the treasury to pay:
^* $LINK<Maintenance=GCON_Maintenance> costs for city improvements.
^* Support for military units in excess of those allowed by your $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> types.
^* Payments you may be making to rival civilizations as part of a $LINK<diplomatic agreement=GCON_Agreements>.
^* To build $LINK<Embassies=GCON_Embassies> and conduct diplomatic and espionage missions.
^* To $LINK<hurry production=GCON_Hurry_Production> of city build projects.



#GCON_Fortresses
Fortresses
^
^
^When a civilization has learned $LINK<construction=TECH_Construction>, its workers know how to construct
stone and masonry [fortresses]. Military units inside these bastions have a few advantages.
^* They get a 50% defensive bonus if attacked.
^* They have a $LINK<zone of control=GCON_ZOC> and fire at passing enemy units without receiving return fire.
^
^
^{Upgrade}  A worker can improve a fortress by building a $LINK<barricade=GCON_Barricades>.



#GCON_Happy_Faces
Happy Faces
^
^
^City improvements, wonders, entertainers, and luxuries produce either [content] or [happy faces] in the
city where they exist. 
^
^{These								Produce this}
^* City improvements						content faces
^* Wonders								content faces
^* Military police							content faces
^* Luxuries								happy faces
^* Entertainers							happy faces
^* Entertainment							happy faces
^
^Each happy face affects the $LINK<mood=GCON_Moods> of one citizen.
^* Each [content face] makes one unhappy citizen content.
^* Each [happy face] makes one content citizen happy.
^
^If there aren't enough faces of the appropriate sort in a city, extra faces will have a limited "carry over" effect. For example, if a city has the capability to generate 5 happy faces, yet there are only 2 content faces in the city, then those 2 content faces will become happy and the remaining 3 happy faces will carry over to unhappy citizens at reduced efficiency.
^
^Certain political events, such as winning or losing battles and wars, can also influence the overall happiness in your civilization's cities.



#GCON_Disorder
Civil Disorder
^
^
^[Civil Disorder] is a state of near anarchy in a city, in which the city essentially freezes and shuts down:
^* $LINK<Production=GCON_Shields> ceases,
^* No revenue comes in from $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and
^* No excess $LINK<food=GCON_Food> is stored.
^
^
^Prolonged periods of civil disorder can lead to:
^* Destruction of existing $LINK<city improvements=MENU_City_Improvements> or even sabotage to ongoing projects by angry mobs.
^* $LINK<Defection=GCON_Conversion> of the city to a nearby rival civilization with a strong culture.
^* An overthrow of your $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> and descent of your empire into anarchy.
^
^
^Civil disorder erupts when a city has more unhappy than happy citizens. The only remedy is to improve the 
$LINK<mood=GCON_Moods> of the people in the city.



#GCON_Specialists
Specialists
^
^
^It is sometimes necessary to fine-tune a city's production. To do so, you'll want specialists.
Specialists do not work in the city radius so they don't contribute to city production of food or commerce.
Instead, they produce extra happy faces, enhance scientific research, tax revenue, or shield production, or
help control corruption.
^
^
^{Entertainers}
^An entertainer produces one $LINK<happy face=GCON_Happy_Faces>.
^
^{Scientists}
^A scientist produces extra $LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research>.
^
^{Tax Collector}
^A tax collector produces extra $LINK<tax revenue=GCON_Commerce>.
^
^{Police Officers}
^Once $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism> has been researched, a police officer can be used to help keep a
lid on $LINK<corruption=GCON_Corruption> in a city.
^
^{Civil Engineer}
^Once $LINK<Replaceable Parts=TECH_Replaceable_Parts> has been researched, a Civil Engineer can be used to
produce additional $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields> which can be applied toward the production of city
Improvements and wonders.
^
^
^To create one of these specialists, on the [City Display], click any square currently being worked;
the production icons disappear and an Entertainer appears among the population. If you wanted an entertainer,
you're done. If you wanted a different specialist, click on the entertainer to cycle through all the
specialists. Note that Police Officers and Civil Engineers are not available until Nationalism or
Replaceable Parts (respectively) have been researched.



#GCON_Airfields
Airfields
^
^
^Airfields function in the same manner that a city with an airport would for air units.  To construct an Airfield, 
move a worker to any neutral or owned land tile and select the Build Airfield unit action.  Construction of the 
Airfield consumes the worker.  Airfields can be a re-base mission destination.  All air missions can be launched 
from an airfield, and there is no limit to the number of aircraft that can be re-based at an Airfield.  Airfields 
can only be used by the player who created it.  If it falls into the territory of another civilization, however, 
the airfield becomes solely useable by the player whose territory it lies in (unless they have yet to research 
Flight, in which case the airfield is destroyed).  Airfields can be pillaged like a terrain improvement, which 
also destroys the airfield.  Airfields can only be built in tiles that have no other improvements, an airfield, 
a colony, a road or a railroad. The "Build Airfield" unit-action becomes available after the Flight advance is 
researched.

#GCON_Outposts
Outposts
^
^
^Outposts eliminate fog of war.  To construct an Outpost, move a worker to any land tile in neutral or owned 
territory and select the Build Outpost unit action.  Construction of the Outpost consumes the worker.  The range 
of vision for the Outpost is 2 tiles on flat terrain, 3 on hills and 4 on mountains.  Outposts can only be used 
by the player who created them.  If an Outpost falls within the territory of any other civilization, it will be 
destroyed.  Outposts can only be built in a tile that is empty, has a mine, irrigation, a road and/or a railroad.
You cannot build an Outpost on a tile with an Airfield or a Colony.  The "Build Outpost" unit-action becomes 
available after the Masonry advance is researched.

#GCON_Radar_Towers
Radar Towers
^
^
^Radar Towers provide a combat bonus to units within their affected area.  To construct a Radar Tower, move a 
worker to any land tile within your territory and select the "Build Radar Tower" unit action. Construction of 
the Radar Tower consumes the worker.  The range of the effected area is 2 tiles. Friendly units within the Radar 
Towers range get a +25% attack and defense bonus.  This bonus can only be applied once, even if multiple towers 
overlap.  Radar Towers can only be used by the player who created them.  Should a Radar Tower fall into the 
territory of another civilization, it will be destroyed.  Radar Towers can only be built in a tile that is empty, 
has a mine, irrigation, a road and/or a railroad.  The "Build Radar Tower" unit-action becomes available after 
the Radio advance is researched.

#GCON_Short_Game_Modes
Short Game Modes
^{Regicide}
^Regicide is a victory condition, in which each player has a "King" unit. This unit represents the 
civilization's Great Leader (for the Americans, the 'King' unit is Abraham Lincoln). When the Regicide victory 
condition is enabled, if the "King" unit is killed, the controlling player is eliminated from the game. Once 
the "King" has been eliminated, all units, colonies, airbases, and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, 
becoming ruins until something new is built on it. The Regicide victory condition can be enabled on the Player 
Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.
^
^{Mass Regicide}
^Mass Regicide is a victory condition, in which each player has several "King" units. These units represent 
the civilization's Great Leader (for the Americans, the "King" unit is Abraham Lincoln). When the Mass Regicide 
victory condition is enabled, if all of a player's "King" units are killed, the controlling player is eliminated 
from the game. Once the "Kings" have been eliminated, all units, colonies, airbases, and cities belonging to 
that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built in that location. The Mass Regicide 
victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.

^{Elimination}
^Elimination is a victory condition. When this victory condition is enabled, any civilization that loses a 
city to an enemy is eliminated from the game. Once a player has been eliminated, all units, colonies, airbases, 
and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built in that location.  
The Elimination victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in

^{Wonder Victory}
^This is a new method of suddenly bringing a game to conclusion. If this condition is enabled the game ends as

^{Capture the Princess}
^Capture the Princess is a method of scoring victory points. Each player starts with a "Princess" unit. This 
unit has no unit actions and can be captured. The "Princess" unit is immobile until it is captured, at which 
point it moves with its owning unit at its speed. The "Princess" unit starts in the players starting location. 
The goal for each player is to capture this unit and return it to their own capital, bestowing them with 1000 
victory points. You may capture the "Princess" when any unit is in the tile with the "Princess" and executes the 
"Capture" unit action. Once captured, the "Princess" unit is spawned again at the original owner's Capital City.  
If there is no suitable city for the "Princess" to re-spawn in, it remains in the captor's Capital and bestows 
another 1,000 points upon that player.
^
^{Victory Location}
^Victory Location is a method of scoring victory points. Victory Location tiles are scattered about the map,
represented on the map by a Victory Location icon. Players score points by capturing and holding Victory
Location tiles. To score these points a unit with a defensive military stat must be in that tile at the end of
all players' turns for that turn. Each turn a Victory Location is controlled, the controlling player gets 25
victory points. In single player mode, the starting location of each player is designated a Victory Location.
Any terrain improvement, including cities, can be built on a Victory Location tile.
^
^{Reverse Capture the Flag}
^Reverse Capture the Flag is a new method of scoring victory points. This condition cannot be enabled for a random
map game; it can only be used in a custom-made scenario. When in effect, one or more Victory Units (which might
look like a "Holy Relic") will be present on the map. Like a "Princess" unit, a "Holy Relic" can only be
transported by another unit. When the Victory Unit is delivered to a Victory Location (see above), the player
scores a substantial amount of victory points.

^When cities grew to a size where the resources were insufficient to adequately insure a decent standard of 
living for the populace, adventurous groups of citizens set out on their own in search of a place to build 
a new city. Once a suitable site was found, the settlers would build their new homes, and develop the land 
surrounding the city. Eventually the whole process repeated, and the new city would send out settlers of 
its own. This process allowed civilizations to grow throughout history, from the empires of the ancient 
world to the discovery and settlement of the New World.

#DESC_PRTO_Worker
^
^
^In primitive, hunter-gatherer cultures, there was no division of labor. But every civilization since has had a 
worker "class," devoted to the production of goods and the unskilled tasks necessary for the maintenance of society. 
In most early societies, slaves and peasants fulfilled this role. With the coming of the Middle Ages, the more 
specialized workers organized themselves into craft guilds. The technological advances of the Industrial Age gave 
rise to a new class of semi-skilled workers: wage laborers, most of which worked in factories and offices. 
Continuing trends in the specialization and professionalism of labor during the late 20th century has not altered 
the fact, however, that civilization still rests upon the shoulders of those who till the fields and build the 
roads.

#DESC_PRTO_Warrior

^
^The earliest military forces were simply the citizens of the city, armed with whatever implements they could 
use as weapons. Although a militia made up of warriors was inexpensive, they were no match for organized 
armies. Warriors were usually used as stopgap measures while waiting for superior units to be trained, or to 
defend a city that had been temporarily cut off from military support. In a crisis situation, an assembly of 
warriors is better than no defense at all.

^[Archers] are late Stone Age warriors armed with sinew bows and flint-tipped arrows.
#DESC_PRTO_Archer
^
^
^The bow and arrow, invented in prehistoric times, greatly improved the hunting skills of early man, allowing 
him to kill his targets from a distance. The bow was eventually adapted for use in battle, and was first used 
by Egyptian, Persian, and Assyrian armies as early as 5000 BC. The range provided by the bow allowed small 
forces of archers to rout armies of superior number armed only with hand-to-hand weapons. Archers were often used 
to soften enemy resistance prior to sending in mounted and skirmishing forces. Refinements in design and 
construction allowed the bow to remain an effective weapon until firearms finally replaced it in the 1500s.



#PRTO_Longbowman
^
^
^[Longbowmen] are excellent attackers in the middle ages.
#DESC_PRTO_Longbowman
^
^
^Longbowmen were highly skilled archers capable of firing up to six arrows a minute over long distances into massed enemy formations. Using bows constructed from a 
type of wood called Yew, they used arrows specifically designed to penetrate chainmail armor -- even plate if close enough. Frequently they would
comprise approximately four-fifths of an army, and their devastating attacks helped to reverse the dominance of knights in warfare. Only lightly-armored,
they enjoyed a great mobility advantage should their opponents survive their barrages.
^
^Once gunpowder began to find applications in the military, their
use began to wane. Guns allowed foot soldiers the same effectiveness against knights, but without the decades of training required to be proficient
with the longbow.



#PRTO_Bowman

^[Babylonian bowmen] are excellent marksmen of the ancient era.
#DESC_PRTO_Bowman
^
^
^The Babylonians utilized a number of different archer types, typically categorized by the amount of armor they wore. These units
fulfilled a number of useful roles in the conquest-focused armies of the time, including sophisticated combined-arms tactics.
Their composite bows, when massed in sufficient numbers, could assist chariots and other horse units in disrupting lines and 
formations. When used in sieges, they would keep the ramparts clear of soldiers so that the infantry could safely close and 
scale the city walls. Sometimes these skilled warriors enjoyed the benefit of a shield 
carrier. These wicker, curved  shields would help protect the bowman from attacks coming from the front and above.



#PRTO_Spearman
^
^
^[Spearmen] are the first and best defensive units of the Bronze Age.
#DESC_PRTO_Spearman
^
^
^Though early man probably employed spears of fire-hardened wood, spearheads of knapped stone were used long 
before the emergence of any distinction between hunting and military weapons. Bronze spearheads closely followed 
the development of alloys hard enough to keep a cutting edge and represented, with the war ax, the earliest 
significant military application of bronze. Spearheads were also among the earliest militarily significant 
applications of iron, no doubt because existing patterns could be directly extrapolated from bronze to iron. 
Though the hafting is quite different, bronze Sumerian spearheads of the 3rd millennium BC differ only marginally 
in shape from the leaf-shaped spearheads of classical Greece. The spears of antiquity were relatively short, 
commonly less than the height of the warrior, and typically were wielded with one hand. As defensive armor and 
other weapons of shock combat (notably the sword and mounted troops) improved, spear shafts were made longer and 
the use of spearmen became increasingly specialized. The Greek hoplite's spear was about nine feet long; the 
Macedonian sarissa was twice that length in the period of Alexander's conquests. The Middle Ages would see the 
evolution of the spear into the pike and halberd.

#DESC_PRTO_Pikeman
^
^
^The growing deployment of knights on the battlefield demanded that foot soldiers develop new means of fighting 
that would lessen their vulnerability to mounted opponents. One of the best ways to do this was to 
lengthen the reach of the infantrymen by arming them with long, sturdy spears known as pikes. Massed infantry 
armed with pikes -- particularly in conjunction with archers -- managed to even the battlefield odds. Armies equipped in this 
manner were able to hold their own until the invention of gunpowder made archers, pikemen, and knights a thing of the past.



#PRTO_Hoplite

^
^Perhaps the best defender in the ancient era, the [Greek Hoplite] can dominate the Bronze Age world.
#DESC_PRTO_Hoplite
^
^
^Hoplites were well-trained citizen-soldiers of ancient Greece. Armed with spears and durable armor, they
fulfilled the heavy infantry role in most engagements.
^
^Hoplites will always be associated with the phalanx unit formation. This tactic involved 
tightly packed groupings of eight or 16 rows of soldiers, who, against other citizen-soldiers, move and attack
in unison scattering less densely organized enemy forces. This tactic worked well, but broke down when facing
more mobile and well-trained professional soldiers. The Roman legions victory over the Macedonian phalanx at Pydna in 
168 BC effectively ended the Hoplite's battlefield usefulness.

#DESC_PRTO_Impi
^
^
^Upon coming to power, one of Shaka's first acts was to reorganize the Zulu army. Shaka first rearmed his men with 
long-bladed, short-hafted stabbing assegais, which forced them to fight at close quarters. He then instituted a 
regimental system based on age groups, quartered at separate kraals (villages) and distinguished by uniform 
markings on shields, headdress and ornaments. And he developed standard tactics, which the Zulu used in every 
battle thereafter. Each impi was divided into four groups. The strongest, termed the "chest," closed with the 
enemy to pin him down, while two "horns" raced out to encircle and attack the foe from behind. A reserve, known 
as the "loins," was seated nearby, with its back to the battle so as not to become unduly excited, and could be 
sent to reinforce any part of the ring if the enemy threatened to break out. Besides their prowess in battle, the 
Zulu warriors could cover tremendous distances, an impi consistently covered 50 miles a day, living off grain and 
cattle requisitioned from the kraals it passed and accompanied by young boys who carried the warriors' sleeping 
mats and cooking pots.

^Mercenaries first came to prominence in Europe in the 14th century, when soldiers from the Hundred Years' War preferred to 
continue fighting for a living rather than learn peacetime trades.  Swiss soldiers in particular enjoyed an especially high 
reputation for loyalty and professionalism, and several European nations incorporated Swiss mercenary regiments into their armies.  
The Netherlands, in particular, employed huge numbers of mercenaries, since the strength of the Dutch nation was commerce and wealth.  
This allowed Dutch princes and stadtholders to pay mercenaries well and regularly, which led to extremely effective fighters.  
The most famous assignment of Swiss mercenaries is the personal safety of the Pope; a special unit of Swiss soldiers, the Swiss Guard, 
has pledged to protect the Pope and the Vatican for the last 500 years.

^The Chasqui scout system was the Incan equivalent to the Pony Express. Fast, agile, and capable of running long distances, Chasqui scouts carried memorized messages along the Imperial road systems of the Andes Mountains. Couriers donned with distinctly white feathered headdresses, Chasquis would memorize information, carry it to other scouts waiting along the relay system, and then run along with them until they memorized the message, and so on until the message was delivered. In this way, 
a message could travel over hundreds of miles within a few short days.

^The Mayan army was comprised of warriors armed with a variety of weapons: lances, clubs, daggers, and even tridents. When the Aztecs introduced them to the [atl-atl] (a tool used to extend the throwing range and penetration strength of a javelin) in the 9th century, the javelin thrower became a staple in the Mayan warrior class. Capable of launching spears in rapid succession, the javelin thrower is a powerful force on the battlefield. 
^
^The primary purpose of war for the Mayans was not to kill the enemy, but to enslave him. In particular, the capture of the enemy’s leader. He and his direct subordinates were carried triumphantly to the captors’ city, where they were summarily sacrificed to the gods. The rest of the vanquished army was enslaved. Therefore, the Javelin Thrower has the ability to "enslave".

^The advantages of a long, sharp blade in battle had to await advanced smelting and casting technologies before 
they could be realized. By about 1500 BC the war ax had evolved into the sickle sword, a bronze sword with a 
curved, concave blade and a straight, thickened handle. Bronze swords with straight blades more than three feet 
long have been found in Greek grave sites; however, because this length exceeded the tensile strength of bronze, 
these swords were not practical. As a serious military weapon, the sword had to await the development of 
ironworking, and the first true swords date from about 1200 BC. Swords in antiquity and classical times tended 
to be relatively short, at first because they were made of bronze and later because they were rarely called upon 
to penetrate armor. The blade of the classic Roman stabbing sword, the gladius, was only some two feet long, 
though in the twilight years of the empire the gladius gave way to the spatha, the long slashing sword of the 
barbarians and forerunner of the great broadswords of medieval Europe.

a larger warlord's protection. Their handsome lacquer armor gave them durable protection on the battlefield. 
The warrior code of "Bushido" placed exacting restrictions on their behavior, both on the field of battle and off.
One such tenet was that samurai of opposing forces must seek each other out and battle one on one. While their
armor provided some safety from early gunpowder weapons, soon more advanced weaponry and skilled
marksmen relegated them to administrative and leadership roles. The samurai caste was abolished in 1868.

ruthlessness and aggression back to Europe when the Crusades ended -- as in the case of the Teutonic
Knights, who offered to defend Poland from invaders and ended up taking charge of a big chunk of the
kingdom they promised to defend. Often originating in apparently benign orders (such as the Hospitallers,
who, true to their name, ran hospitals all over Europe), crusaders were often motivated by ambition and
the desire to rule their own kingdoms in the Near East.

fighting from horseback with a variety of weapons date back to ancient Egypt, horse-mounted cavalry as we 
generally think of it today actually began in the late 1700s. Under Napoleon, the cavalry became an elite 
force, frequently deployed simultaneously with foot soldiers to mask the movements of the main battle force. 
Cavalry were used extensively in the American Civil War, and in other conflicts throughout the mid to late 
19th century. When the repeating rifle replaced earlier single-shot firearms, horse-mounted troops became 
easy targets for infantrymen. The South African War, from 1899 to 1902, was the last major conflict where

to the battlefield, where they would disembark and fight. The Assyrians, whose archers and spearmen fought 
from inside the chariot itself, turned the vehicle into a fearsome offensive weapon. Few enemies were able 
to withstand an onslaught of Assyrian chariots. This devastating form of attack was soon adopted by many of 
the Assyrians' enemies, who used the chariot against them with good effect.

^Skilled horsemen dwelling in the northern steppes of the Black and Caspian Sea regions, the Cossack hosts had a 
tradition of fierce independence and, after decades of conflict, finally received privileges from the Russian 
government in return for military services. In the 16th century there were six major Cossack hosts: the Don, the 
Greben (in Caucasia), the Yaik (along the Ural River), the Volga, the Dnieper and the Zaporozhian (west of the 
Dnieper). Under the Russian umbrella, the Cossacks expanded eastward from their settlements in the Don and were 
early colonizers of Siberia. From the 18th through the 20th centuries, the Czars used Cossacks extensively to 
suppress revolutionary activities and conduct foreign wars. During the Russian Civil War (1918-20), the Cossacks 
in southern Russia formed the core of the White armies there and suffered extensively. Under Soviet rule, the 
Cossack communities ceased to function as distinctive entities.

^The necessity for speed and mobility in times of war was recognized even in ancient times. The infantrymen of 
some ancient armies would ride horses to get from one engagement to another, dismounting to fight when they 
reached the battlefield. Because of their speed, horsemen could also be used as scouts to pinpoint enemy 
positions. In the second century BC, the Chinese invention of the stirrup allowed this concept of mobility to 
go one step further. Stirrups provided the stability and leverage necessary to allow soldiers to fight from 
horseback, leading to the earliest examples of mounted combat units. Continuing developments in arms and armor 
eventually led to knights, dragoons, and finally to the advanced cavalry of the 18th and 19th century.

Fighting astride powerful horses, armored knights had a distinct advantage over enemies on foot and remained

Candra Gupta defeated Alexander's successor Seleucus and established the Mauryan Empire. Though Carthage's African 
war elephants accomplished little subsequently, their presence in Hannibal's army during his transit of the Alps 
into the heart of Rome in 218 BC established their reputation as a fearsome weapon. The elephant's tactical 
importance apparently stemmed in large part from its willingness to charge both foot soldiers and cavalry and from 
the panic that it inspired. Although used in Indian military forces until the 20th Century, as with so many 
traditional weapons, the utility of elephants in war ended with the widespread use of gunpowder.

Horses revolutionized the hunting of game for the North American natives, making it much more profitable and 
allowing ever larger populations to move beyond subsistence. Although the Iroquois and other Eastern tribes did not 
use the horse in warfare as extensively as did the Plains Indians, nevertheless mounted warriors served as scouts

^The age of mounted combat has generally been viewed from a European perspective, since it was there that infantry 
was overthrown and that the greatest and most far-reaching changes in cavalry tactics occurred. But it was by no 
means an exclusively European phenomenon; indeed, the mounted warrior's tactical supremacy was less complete in 
western Europe than in the vast Asiatic steppes that bordered China. Evidence from the region suggests that horses 
were first mounted about 4000 BC, but their role in warfare was trivial until the Han dynasty. The fame of the 
large Parthian warhorses reached the Chinese imperial court and led the emperor Han Wu Ti to send an expedition 
westward as far as Fergana to bring back specimens of the new breed in 101 BC. These were mated with the sturdy 
Mongolian horses, and for the next several centuries the Chinese emperors employed both horse archers and armored 
horsemen to guard the borders against barbarian incursions and the vital Silk Road caravans from raiders. 
Ironically, the invading Mongols would eventually turn these against Chinese rulers themselves.

^The chariot was the earliest means of transportation in combat other than man's own powers of locomotion. The 
earliest known chariots, shown in Sumerian depictions from about 2500 BC, were not true chariots but four-wheeled 
carts with solid wooden wheels, heavy and cumbersome and lacking a pivoting front axle. The Hyksos apparently 
introduced the Assyrian chariot into Egypt shortly thereafter, where it was perfected for transportation and 
warfare. Within 500 years, Egyptian, Hittite and Palestinian chariots were extraordinarily light and maneuverable 
vehicles, the wheels and tires in particular exhibiting great sophistication in design and fabrication. Egyptian 
war chariots were drawn by either two or three horses, which were harnessed by means of chest girths secured by a 
pole and a yoke. The decline of the war chariot by the end of the 2nd millennium BC was probably related to the 
spread of iron weaponry, but it was surely related also to the breeding of horses with sufficient strength and 
stamina to carry an armed man into battle. Armed horsemen replaced the chariot in most Mediterranean civilizations. 
The use of chariots in war lingered in areas of slower technological advance, but in classical Egypt they were 
retained mainly for ceremonial functions.

developed in the 14th century, firearms evolved quickly, and by the late 17th century flintlock muskets had 
become commonplace in battle. Musketeers, who were relatively inexpensive to equip and train, proved a deadly 
foe for the knights who had dominated the battlefield for so many years. Armies were often comprised of a 
combination of musketeers, cannon, and knights, each complementing the strengths and weaknesses of the others.
Large forces of musketeers within a fortress or behind city walls proved an exceedingly difficult 
obstacle to an attacking army. Muskets were the primary firearms in use until they were replaced by repeating 
rifles in the mid-19th century.

of the army. Training not only included mastery of all weapons, from epee to musket, but instruction in social 
skills and military etiquette as well. In peacetime, the Musketeers served as the King's personal escort. Monsieur 
Treville, one of the Louis XIII's advisors and ardent sponsor of the Musketeers, and Cardinal Richelieu, who 
maintained his own company of guards, were political adversaries until the banishment of Treville following a 
1642 plot to assassinate the Cardinal. Following that, the prestige of the Musketeers declined. In the military

ancestors, with much more accuracy over a greater range than the musket and a much higher rate of fire.

^Riflemen were first employed in large numbers during the American Civil War. The rifle gave a strong

^
^The first long range unit, [Artillery] can bombard targets two squares distant. Artillery has no attack 
or defense value, so they should be protected by an escort.
#DESC_PRTO_Artillery
^
^
^Artillery is a general term covering several varieties of large-caliber weapons including mortars and field 
guns. Mortars fire an explosive projectile in a high arc, and are particularly effective against small, 
concealed targets. Field guns, long-range weapons that fire their projectiles in a flat arc, are used 
primarily for their ability to penetrate hard targets. Powerful enough to batter opposing forces even behind
the strongest fortifications, artillery is also able to move quickly from one firing position to another. 
This is an important capability when fighting a moving battle or when avoiding enemy fire.



#PRTO_Radar_Artillery
^
^
^Radar Artillery are highly advanced stand-off attack units. The radar allow them to see up to two squares distant,
regardless of blocking terrain, and fire that far as well. Radar Artillery has no attack 
or defense value, so it should be protected by an escort.

^A city must have $LINK<aluminum=GOOD_Aluminum> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build radar artillery.
#DESC_PRTO_Radar_Artillery
^
^
^Modern radar has had two major impacts on field artillery. The first is that it can accurately "trace" fire from enemy
artillery back to their firing location. The second is to better aim their own artillery to return fire more quickly
and accurately. While increasing the technical sophistication of indirect fire weapons (including the support personnel
required to maintain such high tech devices), it has also increased their flexibility. Radar has enabled the precise 
targeting of enemies at any time of day, in any weather condition.



#PRTO_Cruise_Missile

^Cruise missiles are long-range, fire-and-forget weapons that can find the target on their own. Like all artillery-type
units, cruise missiles have no attack or defense values, only bombardment.

#DESC_PRTO_Cruise_Missile
^
^
^One of the most effective weapons in modern military arsenals is the cruise missile. The AGM-86 and the Tomahawk can be launched against a strategic target hundreds of miles away, traveling low 
to avoid radar and other means of detection, and hitting their target with unnerving accuracy.  They can also 
be used against short-range, tactical targets such as ships. In this role, it is often possible for a single, 
one million dollar missile to seriously damage or even destroy 80 million dollar warships.



#PRTO_Nuke

^
^Tactical nuclear missiles have a long range and devastating effect. They can be loaded onto nuclear subs and launched from
the sea. If used, nuclear weapons have a tremendous negative effect upon world opinion.

#DESC_PRTO_Nuke
^
^
^Tactical nuclear weapons are those whose payload is typically less than five kilotons. These weapons are designed to be used
in close range of friendly troops, and attempt to minimize collateral damage. One method of this involves "boosting" the
radiation effects of a nuclear blast, which reduces the destructive fireball. Such bombs have the added benefit of 
irradiating tanks and other instruments of war. During the blast any crew of such a vehicle would be instantly killed from 
radiation 10 times stronger than the documented "lethal" dose. Should that vehicle be manned within the next 24-48 hours, 
the new crew would suffer the same fate. While fears of blurring the line between conventional and nuclear warfare have 
restricted deployment of these weapons, many world powers continue to investigate the concept of battlefield nuclear weapons. 



#PRTO_ICBM

^
^An [ICBM] (inter-continental ballistic missile) has an unlimited range, and like the tactical nuke, has a devastating effect. They cannot be moved from the
city that builds them but can strike any target on the map. Nuclear weapons, if used, have a tremendous negative effect
upon world opinion.

^The use of atomic bombs at Nagasaki and Hiroshima at the end of World War II changed the world's 
standards for measuring military power. Nuclear weapons can eradicate ground forces and armored divisions, 
and flatten cities with their awesome explosive power. In the years following World War II, arsenals of 
nuclear weapons were rapidly built by opposing nations, each fearing the capabilities of the other. This 
massive arms buildup has acted as a deterrent to full-scale war, since all the governments involved are 
aware of the consequences should such a war take place. The threat imposed by the huge nuclear arsenals of 
the world powers may one day be eradicated by the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI, 
a system designed to destroy enemy missiles in flight before they can reach their targets.

^The galley was the first ship designed for war. Introduced by the Greeks, galleys were powered by banks
of oars on each side, manned by well-trained oarsmen. These oarsmen were highly paid professionals or 
patriotic citizens, not slaves and prisoners as depicted in fiction. A huge, bronze "beak" mounted at the 
bow of the ship was used to ram and sink enemy ships. Because of its long, narrow hull, the galley was very 
unstable in all but the calmest waters, and as a consequence its crew rarely ventured out of sight of land 
for long periods of time, lest the ship be caught in a storm and sunk.

^The dromon was the end result of Byzantine ingenuity applied to old Greek ship designs. Powered by
rowers, its primary virtue was its versatility -- the wide, flat decks could be mounted with a variety
of weapons. There were many classes of dromon, from light escort and reconnaissance designs to heavy
warships. Dromons often included mini-forts made of wood from which marines could sally forth or fire
bows, as well as catapults, rams, ballistae, and later, Greek fire launchers. These dangerous and
devastating primitive flamethrowers spelled death to enemies in an age where all ships were made of

often used as a warship, the caravel could also carry just over 100 metric tons of cargo. The Spanish and the 
Portuguese used caravels for both commerce and exploration. Christopher Columbus' three ships, the 
"Nina," "Pinta," and "Santa Maria," were caravels that risked the hazards of an ocean crossing.

^The frigate was a fast and powerful warship that evolved to fill several important roles, but one of its
primary roles was to raid enemy shipping. These three masted ships were lighter and faster than the European great 
ship or man-of-war, and usually carried 36 or fewer guns. The frigate was powerful enough to overcome most 
of its prospective opponents and fast enough to escape those it could not outgun. Because of their speed and 
strength, frigates were often employed as escorts for merchant vessels during times of war. The frigate 
remained the most useful and dominant naval vessel until the development of the ironclad.

^By the middle of the 17th century cannons arrayed along the sides of fighting ships had become the decisive weapon
of naval warfare. Heavy guns required a gun deck and a short, sturdy hull, which were at odds with the galley's 
requirements of lightness and length. The late Elizabethan galleon that became the true man-o-war class reached 
its culmination in England's Prince Royal of 1610 and the larger Sovereign of the Seas of 1637, mounting guns on 
three decks; the Sovereign of the Seas, the most formidable ship afloat in its time, carried 100 guns. By the 
mid-1700s, great ships-of-the-line such as the British Victory and French L'Orient dominated naval warfare, and 
would continue to do so until the advent of the ironclad.

foes. To facilitate anonymity, very little compensation was paid to the crew and captain by their patron government. Rather,
they were given a portion of the cargo and goods seized in the execution of their duties. While this made the profession
popular with their crew, it eventually became a critical element of the practices disbanding. When nations attempted to
staff their own navies for brewing conflicts, they frequently were unable to secure the manpower needed (all able bodied sailors
already in privateering). Privateers were wide-spread throughout most European history, but they finally vanished during the 19th
century.

^Ironclads were the forerunners of future generations of armored naval vessels. Instead of the simple wooden 
hulls found on the other ships at the time, ironclads were covered with strong metal plating. This plating 
made them nearly impervious to large-caliber explosive shells that would easily penetrate and destroy wooden 
vessels. Ironclads made their first appearance during the American Civil War, and quickly gained dominance 
over other ships of that era. Perhaps the most famous naval battle of the Civil War was the battle between 
the Confederate ironclad "Merrimack", and the Union ironclad "Monitor", which lasted for several hours before 
the "Merrimack" was forced to withdraw.

^A submarine is a submersible warship, designed to attack enemy vessels while remaining hidden underwater. 
Although defensively weak, submarines are feared because of their ability to make a stealthy approach and 
attack without warning. Often, the presence of a submarine is not detected until the first of the sub's 
torpedoes strikes its target. The Germans first used submarine warfare extensively during World War I. 
Developments after the war, such as sonar, made the submarine even more effective. During World War II, 
submarines were used extensively by all the world's naval powers. Today's submarines, in addition to their 
role as fast attack vessels, also carry nuclear weapons that can be fired from underwater positions just off 
the coast of an enemy country.

used extensively in World War II to provide air and sea cover for carrier groups. One of the primary functions 
of the destroyer is to locate and destroy enemy submarines. Using their sonar equipment to locate the subs, 
and their batteries of depth charges and torpedoes to destroy them, the destroyer forces of World War II were 
the key to the success of many crucial naval operations. Modern destroyers are still used in much the same 
role, as escorts for larger vessels and as submarine hunters. In addition to five-inch guns, the arsenal of

functions: clearing the seas of enemy ships and bombarding enemy coastal targets, usually in preparation for 
an invasion. The battleship's importance began to decline in World War II when the increasing use of fighters 
and bombers launched from aircraft carriers greatly extended the range of naval conflicts. Ship-to-ship combat 
became less frequent than long-range air attacks against enemy battle groups. The last of the U.S. Navy's

of the transition into nuclear, rather than diesel, generators. Typically equipped with both nuclear and anti-submarine 
missiles, they presented a new threat to those nations engaging in nuclear deterrence. Since these mobile, virtually
invisible ships could close to within a few dozen miles of a target, the reaction time to a nuclear attack could be reduced to
minutes. Any nation who relied solely on land based missile launch systems stood a very good chance of being crippled before
any opportunity to retaliate. This imbalance was righted however, as all announced nuclear powers soon had their own
fleet of nuclear attack submarines. The difficulty in detection of nuclear submarines means that only other nuclear submarines

in that they can take off and land vertically. This makes it possible for helicopters to operate in many places 
that would be too small to accommodate a runway. Today, helicopters are used in civilian roles as rescue

^The introduction of jet engines to fighter aircraft changed the way man wages war in the skies. The primary impact was
that of speed, since even early jet engines were able to outperform their rotary peers by three to one. While this improvement
was certainly appreciated by their pilots (speed advantages often translate to more options in air combat), it was some
time before the nature of this change was fully understood. Dogfighting became a significantly more difficult task, since the
window to 'take a shot' was reduced to an instant. The introduction of guided missiles helped address this, as well
as increase engagement ranges to beyond what the pilot could visually see. Though missiles dramatically changed air combat,
cannons still remained a staple of the vehicles' arsenal. Missiles could be jammed, and early attempts were fraught with
unreliability. Without a backup weapon, pilots were often at the mercy of inferior planes, but ones where the pilot wasn't

^The successor to the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the F-15 was the first military aircraft with a genuine 
"look-down/shoot-down" capability, the product of pulse-Doppler radars that could detect fast-moving targets 
against cluttered radar reflections from the ground. Also designated the Eagle, the American F-15 was a 
twin-engine jet fighter produced by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. Based on a design proposed in 1969 for an 
air-superiority fighter, it has also been extensively used in fighter-bomber versions. For two decades, it was the 
primary fighter of the American Air Force. F-15s were delivered to the U.S. Air Force between 1974 and 1994, and 
since have been sold to American allies and assembled under contract in Japan. The "Strike" Eagle carried out much 
of the nighttime precision bombing of Iraqi installations during the Persian Gulf conflict (1990-1991), as well as
sweeping the Iraqi Air Force from the skies.

^Starting in the Second World War, radar technology came into widespread use both for detection and targeting of 
aircraft. Because of this, aeronautical engineers began searching for ways to make aircraft less "visible" to 
electronic tracking and weapon systems. The earliest stealth technologies consisted of coating aircraft with 
materials that would absorb rather than deflect a radar signal. In the late 1970s, designs incorporating this 
technology, as well as a unique fuselage shape designed to deflect radar away from its source, were prototyped. 
The first true stealth fighter, the Lockheed F-117A, flew for the first time on June 18, 1981. This fighter, 
incorporating the latest anti-radar and anti-thermal innovations, is capable of entering enemy territory, 
delivering its payload, and returning to base with little chance of detection. These unique, black aircraft 
served well in the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and have served as the basis for further development of stealth 
aircraft technology.

^Concurrent with the development of a stealth fighter, aeronautical engineers began to apply stealth technology 
to a full-scale bomber. The B-1B bomber, which went into service in 1986 as a replacement for the B-52, 
incorporated some of these innovations. The radar signature of the B-1B was reduced to a mere one percent that of 
the B-52 due to its low cross-section and its minimal use of radar-reflective, hard-edged surfaces. Soon after 
the B-1B entered service, the U.S. Air Force commissioned Northrop to develop a true stealth bomber as an 
eventual replacement. First revealed to the public in 1988, the B-2 stealth bomber uses a flying wing design 
similar in shape to the F-117A stealth fighter. The flying wing design reduces the profile of the B-2 by 
incorporating its engines into the body of the plane. The engine exhausts and intakes are shielded to prevent 
infrared tracking. The B-2 also makes use of curved surfaces and radar-absorbing materials to enhance its 
"invisibility", and make it far less detectable than the B-1B. As of the late 1980s, it was announced that 132 
B-2's would be constructed, and would enter service sometime in the 1990s.

the Mongols to conduct war.  The Mongol's harsh, nomadic lifestyle had prepared them well for the rigors of war; 
they often thrived in conditions that would be considered intolerable by any other military of its time.  When 
the need arose Mongol horsemen could last up to ten days at a time without cooking food, during which they would

afford to equip themselves not only with their slashing and stabbing sword, but also with a helmet and 
shield.  They often charged into battle bare-chested or completely naked, occasionally wearing vividly patterned 
pants or cloaks.  Similar to the Viking Berserker, Gallic Swordsman began their battles by viciously taunting 
their enemies, followed by a mad rush against enemy lines.  Celtic warriors were also known to serve as

7th to 9th centuries was the Ansar Warrior.  Directly translated as "Helper of Muhammad", these warriors 
participated as infantry, but most commonly rode on horseback.  The quality of the Arabian horses quickly led

#DESC_BLDG_Aqueduct

^A major obstacle to population growth and expansion in early cities was the scarcity of water. In many cases, the solution to this problem 
was an aqueduct. Aqueducts were large, elevated stone "canals" through which water from nearby hills and mountains was channeled into the 
city. Aqueducts allowed cities to grow much larger by significantly increasing the amount of available water. At the same time aqueducts 
reduced the chance of contracting water-borne diseases, by reducing the dependence on stagnant ponds and wells as water sources. Aqueducts 
also allowed cities to be built in normally inhospitable environments, such as deserts, by providing an outside water source. Modern day Los 
Angeles, for example, obtains its water supply from the Colorado River, through a system of aqueducts over 200 miles long.

^Early examples of factory-like production, where a number of individuals work cooperatively to produce goods for sale or trade, can be 
found as far back as ancient Greece and Rome. Modern factories, however, evolved from the concept of specialized labor, where each worker 
performed a single step in the overall production of an item. This specialization allows factories to increase the speed and efficiency of 
the manufacturing process, far surpassing earlier means of production. The development of the factory system as a means of production played 
a key role in the Industrial Revolution.

Rome. In the Middle Ages, noblemen protected their estates by appointing constables to enforce the law and to arrest 
and guard criminals, but the first modern, organized police force was the London Metropolitan Police. Established in 
1829, this organization became the model for law enforcement organizations in the United States and many other 
industrialized nations around the world. The presence of a police force serves to uphold the laws of society, and to 
control civil unrest. A strong, visible police force strengthens confidence of the community by keeping the citizens

^The continual growth in city populations leads to an inevitable increase in garbage. Eventually, existing landfills and garbage dumps 
are filled, forcing new dumping sites to be established. This leads to the gradual but steady destruction of the local environment. 
To reverse this problem, many areas have established recycling centers, where much of the garbage is sorted and reduced to reusable 
components through various means. These components are then used to manufacture new products. In this way, much of the trash produced 
is turned into raw materials for production, rather than contributing to the ever-increasing pollution problem.

^Power plants burn coal and other fossil fuels to produce the heat and steam necessary to run generators that produce electrical power. 
When electricity became widely and cheaply available, it meant that industries could convert from steam to electrical power to run their 
machinery. One central power plant could supply the electrical needs of a relatively large geographic area. However, increasing demands 
for electricity, by both consumer and commercial customers, led to a rise in the number of power plants. This, in turn, led to problems 
with air pollution. As more plants went on line, more fossil fuels were burned to generate power. Because modern society depends so heavily 
on electricity, researchers are constantly searching for alternate forms of energy to satisfy ever-increasing demands.

needed to run electrical generators and produce electricity. Because nuclear power doesn't cause the air pollution associated 
with the burning of coal or petroleum products, this means of generating power is considered a viable alternative energy source. 
However, the toxic nature of the byproducts produced by the fission process creates serious problems of its own. No method of 
safely disposing of this toxic waste has been found, and the volatile nature of the fission reaction can lead to a meltdown of 
the reactor core if the reaction is not properly controlled. Because of these problems, the future of nuclear power is uncertain.

^The construction of defensive structures such as city walls and fortified castles dates back to ancient times. 
City walls were designed primarily to repel an attack launched by ground-based forces, and they performed adequately 
in such a situation. However, coastal cities were also vulnerable to attack from sea bombardments, since even a city 
wall left sea ports relatively unprotected. The best way to protect the port was to keep the enemy out of range of 
the city. This was accomplished by constructing fortresses to cover the approach to the city. These coastal fortresses, 
built at the mouth of the city's harbor or on barrier islands, would hold enemy vessels at bay, turning away or thinning 
out the attacking force and minimizing damage to the city's port.

production in Pennsylvania in 1859. Crude oil could be refined into many different byproducts, and soon replaced wood 
and coal in many parts of the world. The growing dependence on oil caused the petroleum industry to grow rapidly and 
wells were drilled all over the world. Most wells were initially drilled on land, but after World War II it was found 
that many of the largest oil deposits could be found below the sea floor. Shallow water drilling from platforms supported

Second World War the threat of aerial attack on cities was sufficient enough that many cities implemented organized civil 
defense strategies.  Citizens were trained in fire fighting, rescue, medical first-aid and shelters were built to protect 
against bombing raids and other attacks.  Other tactics included power blackouts that significantly reduced the glow of 
city lights, typically used as guides by enemy pilots in bombing campaigns.  The introduction of nuclear weapons, capable

^The massive Thrusters are, much like the Engine, designed to function in a myriad of ways. Designed in stages like the 
Engines, the Thrusters channel the exhaust used to propel the Space Ship through all of its phases of travel. In the initial 
phase, the external booster rockets channel their fuel through the Thrusters array until they run out of fuel, at which 
point they are jettisoned. After that, the powerful electromagnets built into the Thrusters help accelerate the charged 
particles of the ion drive to near the speed of light, providing a great deal of thrust for the Space Ship. Finally, in 
the last stages of travel, the Thrusters are responsible for maneuvering the Space Ship into the planet's gravity well 
and providing a counter thrust to slow the vessel to a manageable velocity to settle into a geo-synchronous orbit. In 
order to fulfill all of these functions, the Thrusters array had to be capable of the ultra-sensitive duty of accelerating 
high energy ions as well as be able to handle the hundreds of thousands of pounds of thrust produced by the solid fuel

^The Space Ship Engine is actually a four part launch vehicle, designed to enable the Space Ship to complete its journey 
both within the high gravity space-time bends surrounding star systems and through the vast emptiness of deep space that 
separates our star from Alpha Centauri. Its first stage is the external booster rockets, which, much like the terrestrially 
launched shuttles of the late twentieth century, are solid fuel boosters and are jettisoned when they are no longer 
needed. They are crucial to build the initial impulse which will carry the Space Ship into Jupiter's gravity well, giving 
it the energy to slingshot to Uranus and then out into deep space. The second part to the Engine is the Space Ship's solar 
sail, which was designed both to use the radiation emitted from our sun and Jupiter for propulsion and to collect atomic 
particles for further future fuel and materials. The third part of the Engine array is the ion drive, which will harness 
both nuclear power and collected hydrogen to propel the craft through deep space, channeling high energy particles through 
the Thrusters. The fourth and most externally obvious component is the hydrogen solid fuel rocket, which will be used in

^Essentially designed around the concept of a controlled hydrogen bomb explosion, the Fuel Cells for the Space Ship are 
based around the hydrogen collection system of the solar sail. The electromagnetic and solar energy collected by the solar 
sail are converted to electricity, which is used to slowly build the free hydrogen collected into fuel, which is stored in 
the fuel cell. The fuel cells also contain small, controlled amounts of fissionable material, which is in turn used with 
the hydrogen core to start a nuclear reaction. These reactions, contained in the Fuel Cells, supply the high energy 
particles which are funneled and accelerated through the ion drive to boost the Space Ship in deep space travel. In the 
final stages of travel the Fuel Cells provide the necessary hydrogen, collected in transit, to power the solid fuel rocket. 
The entire process is controlled through powerful electromagnets which channel the energy and prevent the escape of excess 
energy which could produce a dangerous meltdown. One byproduct of this nuclear reaction is heat, which is absorbed in the 
Fuel Cell walls and converted to the electrical energy which powers the computers, Life Support Systems, and other essential 
functions.

these things. Recycling is the key to the Space Ship's Life Support System, and no organic component is left to waste in 
the vessel. Computers control the collection and recycling of waste, which is injected into large vats of algae which 
consume the waste or processed into fertilizer for the Space Ship hydroponics garden. Both the algae and the garden provide 
food and oxygen for the colonists as well as for their livestock, which consist of fish, shrimp, and a particularly hearty 
(and tasty) breed of Peruvian mountain llama. Extra oxygen is processed in the air filtration system, which electrically 
divides water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules and separates them for oxygen and fuel uses. Excess heat produced by the 
Fuel Cells is also absorbed into steam pipes, which are used to keep the interior of the vessel warm and to separate pure 
water out of waste water to a 99.44% purity. Extraplanetary travel has never before been attempted on this scale, and the 
Life Support System has been carefully crafted to provide indefinitely for the needs of the colonists as well as giving 
them a basis for redeveloping a food chain on the eventual planet of colonization.

regulate the zero-oxygen environment to ensure that the colonists will be kept as safe as possible, and a special warming 
system utilizing broad spectrum electromagnetic radiation is used to quickly and safely restore warmth to the body. The 
radiation also has the effect of breaking down the chemical agents that slow the colonists' metabolism, making them able 
to be thawed out in a matter of seconds and fully aware in a little over a minute. This is essential to the survival of 
the craft in a situation in which the computer is unable to determine a course of action and a pilot or navigator must be 
roused to assess the danger, or in a situation in which a technician must be roused to effect repairs. This system has been 
used very effectively in tests on pigs and monkeys, and it has been shown that such animals in deep cryogenic sleep have 
been able to be roused after three years with absolutely no visible side effects. A couple of military volunteers have also 
been frozen to test the system, but only for a matter of weeks. Although scientists have not yet tested the effects of 
long-term freezing on human beings, they are completely confident that there will not be any problems with the Stasis 
Chamber on the Space Ship. Completely confident.

^With a journey on which so much is dependent, including the future survival of humanity in the stars, many preparations 
have been made to insure the survival of the crew both on the journey and once the final destination has been reached. The 
large Storage/Supply module fulfills many functions for the colonists, all of which are considered vital for the perpetuation
of life on distant planets. The first and most obvious function that it fulfills is the storage of raw materials, including 
essential metals and elements which may not be in such plentiful supply in the further reaches of the galaxy. In addition 
to the non-organic elements stored there are also complex amino acid chains stored for eventual use to ensure the survival 
of organic material in the transition period during which the planet is being terraformed. Perhaps more important, though, 
is the storage of the terraforming machines and vehicles which are expected to be necessary once a distant planet is 
reached. They will be used not only to attempt terraforming the planet, but also to build the initial habitat of the 
colonists and mine the planet's resources for use. The most important part of the Storage/Supply unit, in the eyes of many 
scientists, is Project: ARK. A catalogue and series of samples of over 150 million species are included, cryogenically 
frozen and preserved to rebuild as much of Earth's plant and animal kingdom by the genetic engineers in transit with the 
Space Ship.

^Described as the most expensive discotheque and museum gallery ever made, the Planetary Party Lounge is the ultimate in 
terrestrial entertainment. With a full copy of the Library of the National Archives, including all human data able to be 
put on disk, the Planetary Party Lounge computers allow the colonists to read books, play video games, holographically 
browse art museums, and sample every existing bit of human culture from the most sublime to the least savory. Holographic 
instructional videos exist on all manners of craft and skill, from woodcarving to belly dancing, to help keep cultural 
traditions alive and archived for future generations of colonists. The finest entertainers from around the world have been 
recruited to accompany the colonists and keep them happy in their journey to the next star system, and professional masseuses
and physical therapists are on hand to see to the pleasures of the body. But the center of social life on board the Space 
Ship is bound to be the 13 tiered central lounge, boasting a quaint rural pub, a bustling casino, a hip disco, an auditorium
and concert hall, a full featured gymnasium with hot tub and swimming pool, and a number of restaurants, both large and 
small. With so much to do, the colonists and crew aren't likely to want to get back into their Stasis Chambers!

^Although humankind has mastered space flight, the concept of interstellar and deep space travel presents many new problems 
to engineers and physicists. The Exterior Casing of the Space Ship is itself a technological marvel. Designed around a 
composite system of layered ceramic, zero-gee manufactured aluminum-titanium alloy, and high density polymers, the Exterior 
Casing is made to withstand both the dangers of debris within star systems and of radiation throughout its travel. Built 
into the Exterior Casing is also a complex web of electric wiring, capable of carrying a very high positive or negative 
electromagnetic charge, providing a shield from radiation and literally funneling electromagnetic energy and space borne 
hydrogen dust into the solar sail where it can be collected and used for further fuel. It is also designed with multiple 
levels of sensors designed to collect scientific data and to give a clear picture to the navigational computer and to the 
pilots of what is going on outside of the vehicle. Although this composite design for an Exterior Casing is expensive, the 
protection and potential scientific information that it affords is well worth the cost of manufacture.

^The Pharos was a marble watchtower and lighthouse built in 280 BC on an island in the harbor of Alexandria, Egypt. Estimated to have been 300 
feet high, the primary function of the lighthouse was to guide approaching ships to the harbor on an otherwise unmarked coast. Historians debate 
whether fires were burned on the top of the tower, or whether mirrors were used to reflect sunlight. Since ships rarely sailed along coasts at night, 
there was probably little need for the lighthouse after dark. The Pharos was destroyed in the 14th century, after having been damaged by several

was found the rivers were also very useful for generating electricity. Hydroelectric power plants derive power from rivers by constructing dams to 
ensure a dependable supply of water. The overflow is then released through special chambers where the moving water turns giant turbines, 
generating electricity. When planned and engineered properly, this system provides an excellent power source with very limited environmental 
impact. The Hoover Dam, constructed on the Colorado River near Las Vegas, was one of the earliest hydroelectric power plants.

time, the United States held a monopoly on atomic weapons. However, by 1949 the Soviet Union had
also developed similar technology, based in part on Manhattan Project information obtained through
espionage. The nuclear standoff that has resulted from this balance of power may be largely
responsible for the absence of major wars since World War II.

^Created in 1945 to maintain international peace and security, the United Nations was the second of two laudable efforts to 
establish an international authority on law and human rights between the self governing nations of the world. Headquartered 
in New York City, the United Nations was established at the end of World War II in response to the apparent ineffectiveness 
of the League of Nations to prevent another global conflict on the scale of "The War to End All Wars". The organization was 
originally conceived in 1941 as the Atlantic Charter, an agreement signed between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, but developed into a pact signed by 26 countries to try to stop the aggression of the Axis powers. In 1945, in a 
conference between "The Big Three", Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin, the original charter was laid down. Throughout its 
history the United Nations has had great success in establishing many permanent international laws on subjects from human 
rights, international treaties, and worldwide decolonization. Although the United Nations does not have the power to enforce 
decisions or compel nations to take military action, the ability to compel member nations to impose economic sanctions 
against countries guilty of violating security orders gives it significant power in the world stage.

^One of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was an immense, grand temple and marketplace constructed of marble,
financed by the Greek king Croesus (whose name is now synonymous with great wealth). Filled with treasures and statues of bronze, gold, and silver from around
the civilized world, it stood for just two hundred years before it was burned by a fame-seeking arsonist. It was rebuilt twice, but never as grandly as it 
stood at its apex in the 6th century B.C. The Temple was destroyed for the last time by a Christian missionary and saint, who sought to eliminate this 
powerful symbol of the pagan world.

^The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the site of the original Olympic Games held to honor the king of the gods, depicted him as a massive ivory figure clad in robes
and sandals of gold. The statue was almost four stories tall, with its head nearly touching the roof of the temple that housed it. The sculpture is described as
exquisite in even the tiniest details by historians and writers of the day -- its robes intricately carved with designs of animals, flowers, and images of Zeus'
children, and its base surrounded by sphinxes and other mythological creatures. Such a statue could not long escape the notice of greedy kings and warlords, and
several attempts were made to steal the statue -- including one by the crazed Roman emperor Caligula.  The statue was finally successfully stolen about the third
century A.D., and was destroyed in a fire in Constantinople just after the fall of Rome. No images or accurate reconstructions of this, one of the lost Wonders of the

^The tomb of King Mausollos of Caria (from whose name the generic term "mausoleum" derives), a local Persian ruler, was not especially remarkable in its construction or size.  
Its status as one of the Ancient Wonders of the World comes from the dozens of painstakingly carved statues and sculptures that surrounded it. They depicted legendary and 
real people, and the noble animals of mythology and history.  Inside the mausoleum was a great frieze, or wall-carving, depicting an epic battle between the Greeks and the 
Amazons, and topping the mausoleum's dome was a huge statue of a four-horse chariot. The Mausoleum and its statues survived until after the Crusades, when Christian knights 
founded a new crusader kingdom in Asia Minor, and used the already-carved stones of the Mausoleum to build castles. The statues, in turn, spread around the world, until British 
archaeologists began to collect and recover them.  Some can be seen today in museums, but most have been lost or destroyed.

^
^The Knights Templar was a holy order devoted to defending the fledgling crusader states founded during the 
First Crusade against Muslim reconquest. The king of Jerusalem allowed them to make their headquarters in 
the main temple of Jerusalem, from which they took their name. In exchange for this hospitality they swore allegiance 
to the throne of Jerusalem. They participated in several major battles and did very well; this increased their numbers 
substantially. Eventually their power grew so much -- to the point where they could field an army of almost 10,000 knights 
and still uphold their promises to garrison individual towns -- that the Pope decided to place them under his direct control.
^	Templar valor in the Holy Land resulted in many rewards back in Europe; knights who fought under the red cross and white 
field of the Templars often found themselves with new estates and castles in their native countries. As a result the order became 
fantastically wealthy, as the Grandmasters shrewdly invested the order's wealth, using plunder to buy goods and sell them throughout 
the Mediterranean.
^	Kings, however, often become jealous of wealthy organizations over which they have little or no control. The French king 
Philip IV, his treasury emptied and his debts monstrous from constant warfare, accused the Templars of heresy and blasphemy, and 
confiscated almost all of their wealth in France. Other monarchs followed suit, embarking on a program of persecution and repression 
whose goal was mostly to secure the Templars' money for themselves. Hundreds of Templars gave false confessions of heresy under torture, 
and others were burned at the stake. The order died out completely in the early 14th century when the entire Templar leadership had been 
murdered.

^As mankind’s dependence on metals increased through the ages, it became very important to cheaply and effectively separate the base metal from 
impurities. The process of smelting, through the use of a structure called a blast furnace, achieved just that. Using carbon dioxide created from 
oxidized coke to absorb the oxygen from the molten iron, it leaves the metal ‘slag’ to sink to the bottom of the furnace. This separation allows for 
a pure iron to be derived, which is then used for numerous purposes, including the creation of steel.

^Evidence of the use of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, dates back to Thailand in 4500 BC. Several hundred years later, bronze working 
was discovered in the Middle East. Artifacts from this period show that bronze was initially used for decorative purposes only. This is 
because tin was not readily available. It wasn't until approximately 2000 BC, when tin was regularly imported from neighboring regions, that 
bronze replaced copper in the construction of larger items. Bronze was harder and less brittle than copper, and it held a sharper edge. Tools, 
weapons, and armor made from bronze were also cheaper to produce and more durable. The period of time when bronze was the metal of 
choice for such items was known as the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age lasted until iron working became prevalent in approximately 1200 BC.

^The early dwellings of most tribal cultures were built of materials that were readily available and easy to work with, such as bricks of clay 
and mud. As tribes gave up their nomadic ways and settled the first cities, they soon found that they had a need for more permanent and 
durable structures. The skill of masonry was developed to fill this need. The earliest stone structures consisted of little more than rocks that 
were stacked atop one another to form crude walls. Artisans soon began to square off the rocks, forming them into regular shapes and 
stacking them. These early examples of masonry used no mortar; the weight of the stacked stones provided overall strength and stability. 
Without the use of mortar and knowledge of architectural techniques, masonry was used primarily for simple structures such as fortifications. 
However, some examples of early masonry are quite spectacular, including the Great Pyramids in Egypt, which are still standing after 
thousands of years.

between 1700 and 1500 BC. Four other alphabets - South Semitic, Canaanite, Aramaic, and Greek - had evolved from the North Semitic 
alphabet by 1000 BC. The Roman alphabet, used by all the languages of Western Europe including English, was derived from the Greek 
alphabet sometime after 500 BC. The Roman alphabet became one of the most widespread due to the extensive use of the Latin language 
during the reign of the Roman Empire. The development of alphabets was significant in the development of advanced civilizations because it 
allowed history and ideas to be written down, rather than memorized and passed along orally.

animals, a tribe needed sturdy, waterproof containers in which to store and protect surplus food. The discovery of the 
properties of clay, and the invention of the kiln and the potter's wheel made it possible to build such containers. The earliest examples of Western pottery date back 
to as early as 6500 BC. Most of the examples from this period were strictly utilitarian. Although use continued to be primarily practical, 
decorative pottery soon became a ritualistic and aesthetic art form in cultures all over the world. Some of the most impressive examples of 
artistic pottery comes from the pre-Columbian cultures of South America, and from the Ming dynasty in 14th century China.

before the true potential of the wheel was discovered, and wheeled carts soon replaced the sledge as a means of transportation. Rapid 
developments, such as wheels consisting of a ring with radial spokes, made the wheel even more practical by reducing its weight. By using 
the wheel, mankind gained the ability to work more efficiently and travel more quickly. Besides its use in transportation, the wheel went on 
to become the basic principle behind almost every mechanical device.

of behavior known as chivalry was later developed under the feudal system in medieval Europe. Although the strict adherence to both

^Some examples of iron ornamentation date back to 4000 BC, but the use of iron for tools, weapons, and other practical purposes did not 
become common until much later. Prior to this time, bronze was the most widely used metal for such purposes. Although the term "Iron Age" 
denotes a period of time starting around 1000 BC, iron replaced bronze as the metal of choice at different times in different places. Iron is 
more common than copper and tin, the component metals of bronze, but iron is seldom found in a free state; it is most commonly found 
mixed with other minerals and elements. In order to be used, the iron must be separated from the ore. Once this technique was developed, 
and forges hot enough to melt the iron were developed, iron working became commonplace. Worked iron was harder, less brittle, and 
could hold a much sharper edge than bronze. Iron has remained an important metal throughout history, and is one of the major components

symbols and marks, used to keep accounts and inventories. Some cultures developed pictographic symbols to tell stories and record events. 
Eventually, complete systems of writing were developed, capable of conveying any thought that could be expressed orally. At this point, 
scribes replaced the oral historian as the chief keepers of records. Writing allowed the presentation of information in a form that could be 
reliably transmitted from person to person and made it possible for ideas, history, and knowledge to be stored permanently and passed

#DESC_TECH_Mathematics

^
^Rudimentary arithmetic was purely quantitative, used to keep track of quantities and measurements in trade. Building on this fundamental 
base, ancient civilizations began to formulate more complex mathematical concepts. As early as 1800 BC, the Egyptians had developed a 
system for working with fractional numbers and simple algebraic problems. They also formulated geometric formulae for finding area and 
volume, and came up with a constant for determining the area of a circle that was very close to the value of pi. By about the 5th century BC, 
the mathematicians of Greece had greatly contributed to both geometry and algebra. Around the same time, advanced mathematics was 
applied to other sciences and fields of study such as astronomy and mechanics. One of the earliest applications of mathematical principles 
was in the construction of complex weaponry such as the catapult.

were common in a burgeoning upper class. In their leisure time, these people contemplated principles of thinking and being, logic and 
mathematics, and the natures of reality and existence. In ancient times, the study of philosophy was indistinguishable from the study of 
science, and many of the theories formulated by the early philosophers became the basis for studies in the fields of astronomy, medicine, 
chemistry, and physics. The teachings and writings of the ancient philosophers of Greece and the Orient also, in part, laid the groundwork 
for many of the world's oldest organized religions.


#DESC_TECH_Code_of_Laws
^
^
^The earliest tribal civilizations were bonded together by mutual needs and beliefs. A tribal chieftain, who acted as 
an advisor and enforcer of the will of the gods, ruled these groups. No formal laws existed in these early cultures, but fear of the gods and a sense of tribal 
customs and morality kept order in the tribe. As societies became larger and more diverse, the need arose for established rules of conduct. 
The earliest known codes of laws existed in Babylon, India, and Palestine. The Twelve Tables of Rome, written in 500 BC, and its 
successors such as the Justinian Code, were the first codes of law to distinguish between public law, which involves the state, and private 
law, which concerns disputes between citizens. Roman law was the first formalized written system of laws, and went on to influence many 
of the legal systems of the modern world.


#DESC_TECH_Literature
^
^
^The art of writing as literature, bodies of works written thematically, is at least as old in the western world as Greek 
culture. Surviving records of Babylonian culture refer to at least two epic tales, which infers that literature as a 
comprehensive body is much older, but neither survive to this day. The development of a living body of literature became 
indicative of an advanced culture and are always correlated with advances in science, philosophy, theology, and art. 
Literature in the western world has survived in the forms that the Greeks and Romans established, but the expense and 
effort of hand copying texts ensured that only the wealthy had access to literate education. Libraries, which served as 
storehouses of these bodies of text, also became centers for education and the proliferation of ideas. Unfortunately the 
loss of many such libraries, such as the Great Library of Alexandria in a civil war in the 3rd century AD, also heralded 
the loss of  many of these irreplaceable texts. It wasn't until the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg 
that books were printed rather than transcribed. That single advance in literature opened the field up to those other than 
monks and the wealthy, birthing a proliferation of literature that spread across the world.

silk cloth. In between 600 and 200 BC, the Greeks produced several maps of the known world, including the first map showing a primitive 
system of latitude and longitude. Traders and merchants primarily used these early maps. Seamen, who often set their courses based only on

^Tribesmen on the Asian steppes first domesticated the horse for transportation and warfare. These tribesmen used their superior mobility and 
speed to overwhelm the proto-civilizations just rising in southeast Europe and the Middle East. In approximately 2000 BC, domestic horses 
were introduced into Babylonia. Within the next several centuries, horses had spread throughout much of Europe and northern Africa. It was 
not long before nearly every civilization had put horses to work as field animals and as a means of transportation. Horses also went on to play 
an important role in the military conflicts of nearly every civilization in the world, both as mounts for horsemen and cavalry, and as draft 
animals for pulling war chariots and heavy weapons into battle.


#DESC_TECH_Polytheism
^
^
^Polytheism is the belief that the world and the environment is ruled or controlled by a number of different gods or divinities. Many ancient 
religions were polytheistic, notably those of the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Norse, and the Romans. Often, polytheistic religions have different 
gods for each force of nature and earthly phenomenon; for instance: a sun god, a moon god, a god of thunder, a god of the forests, and so 
forth. The reason for such diversity in divine beings probably stems from ancient civilizations attempting to find explanations for natural events 
they could not understand. 



#DESC_TECH_Currency
^
^
^As cities grew, their internal economies became more complicated. People became specialists, some primarily producing grain, some pottery, 
some bricks, etc. A system of barter developed, so that one individual's wares and services could be exchanged for those of another. Gold 
and silver were widely used in such transactions, but the pieces needed to be weighed and tested for purity each time they changed hands. In 
600 BC, the Lydians found a way around this problem. They began the practice of shaping electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, into pieces 
of predetermined weight and purity, stamped with an official symbol. This idea caught on, and within 50 years all the important trading centers 
of the world had adopted similar practices. The widespread use of currency created universal standards of value, allowing people from 
various societies to conduct business almost anywhere without being forced to bring along bulky goods for trade and barter.

the general public. The concept of the republic first appeared in ancient Rome, where local provinces sent elected representatives to the 
Senate, which governed all Roman lands. Both the head of state and the local representatives in a republic are elected; no one is granted a 
position by birth or divine right. Republican governments are similar in some ways to democracies, in that they offer a great deal of personal, 
financial, and political freedom to their citizens. The main difference between the two systems is that a true democracy allows the participation 
of every voting citizen in any and all political matters, whereas in a republic, a body of elected officials represents the views and opinions of 
the people. Although an effective system, personal agendas of political representatives might act to decrease the effectiveness in representing 
the views of the people. Due to human nature, corruption is fairly common in a republican government.


#DESC_TECH_Monarchy
^
^
^Rule by monarchy developed as a logical extension of the absolute rule of tribal chieftains. Many of the earliest monarchs, such as those in 
ancient Egypt, claimed that they ruled by divine right. In the spread of European monarchy during the Middle Ages, however, rulership was 
generally conveyed upon a leader who could most effectively raise and command an army. Monarchies are dynastic, with rule of the country 
passing to the eldest son when the king dies or retires. Monarchs had absolute rule over their subjects, severely limiting the personal and 
economic freedom of all citizens except for nobility and the rich upper class. Although monarchies ruled most of Europe for centuries, the 
unhappiness of lower-class citizens eventually grew intolerable, causing several major revolutions. By the mid-18th century, the power of the 
European monarchs had been severely limited, paving the way for participatory systems of government.

^The development of masonry led to a widespread use of stone in simple structures such as fortifications, but due to the weight and 
cumbersome nature of stone blocks, more complex structures had to be made of simpler materials. The need for the widespread use of 
more durable and permanent materials eventually became apparent, forcing ancient artisans to learn new techniques. The biggest problem to 
overcome was finding a stable way to span the distance between two upright columns or walls using stone blocks. To solve this problem, 
fundamental architectural elements such as the arch and vault evolved. These basic construction techniques allowed larger and more elaborate 
buildings to be created from stone and mortar. Many of the buildings erected by these early builders are still standing, a testament to the 
sound construction techniques employed in their construction.


#DESC_TECH_Monotheism
^
^
^Monotheism is the belief that there is only one God. Perhaps the oldest monotheistic religion is Judaism. The original Israelites were 
polytheistic in a sense, since they did not deny the existence of other gods in addition to their own. However, after being exiled to Babylonia 
in 586 BC, the Judeans turned to a truly monotheistic religion, where the God of Israel was seen as the universal God ruling the destiny of all 
nations. The scriptures of Judaism became part of the teachings of the two most widespread monotheistic religions, Christianity and Islam. 
More developed than earlier polytheistic beliefs, monotheistic religions tend to encompass and structure the entire lifestyles of the people who 
practice them.


#DESC_TECH_Feudalism
^
^
^In the unsettled times following the collapse of Charlemagne's Frankish empire, a new social and political system arose in Europe called 
feudalism. Derived from the concept of monarchy, feudalism was a hierarchical system in which each descending stratum owed allegiance to 
those above. The king, whose authority was second only to God, granted tracts of land, or fiefs, to his barons. The barons might then grant 
smaller estates to knights, who swore to protect and serve the baron. The knights, in turn, might then grant fractions of their fiefs to 
subordinates who would serve the knights. At the bottom of the feudal pyramid were the serfs, who could not own land, and acted essentially 
as slave laborers who worked the land for their masters. Feudalism began to decline in the 13th century, when standing armies and 
mercenaries began to fulfill the protective role once served by the vassals and knights.

^Engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to the design and/or manufacture of theoretical systems and physical 
objects. Prior to the mid-18th century, military engineers carried out all engineering functions. Their work involved the construction of roads, 
bridges, fortifications, and the performance of other duties relating to the military. In the late 18th century, civil engineers took over all 
non-military engineering functions. Other fields of engineering prior to the 20th century included mining engineers, who designed mines and 
methods of mining, and mechanical engineers, who dealt with the design and construction of machinery. As new technologies developed, new 
fields of engineering developed along with them. Today, there are engineers specifically trained in nearly every field, from electronics and 
computers to chemistry and atomics.


#DESC_TECH_Theology
^
^
^Theology is the study of God and religious truth. Theologians take a more or less scientific approach to questions of religion, deeply studying 
the underlying meaning of scriptures and religious teachings rather than "taking them on faith". Theological seminaries teach courses of study in 
theology to prepare people as priests and clergymen. Many of the earliest colleges of the western world were originally established for this 
purpose. Theological study helped to remove some of the superstitions that had surrounded religion for so long, and brought religious study 
into a more enlightened age.


#DESC_TECH_Chivalry
^
^
^Chivalry was a code of rules governing the behavior of an aristocratic class of warriors known as knights. First appearing in the 12th century, 
the rules of chivalry governed not only the knights' behavior in battle, but in their personal lives as well. The chief chivalric virtues of piety, 
honor, valor, courtesy, chastity, and loyalty represented a fusion of Christian and military morality. A similar code of behavior known as 
"Bushido" or "the way of the warrior" governed the behavior of the samurai warriors of ancient Japan. Although the strict practice of chivalry 
had all but disappeared by the 15th century, the ideals of chivalric behavior became the basis for what is now considered to be gentlemanly 
conduct.


#DESC_TECH_Invention
^
^
^The contrivance of a previously unknown device, method, or process, which can, in turn, be used to accomplish an objective in a way 
thought to be impossible, is known as invention. Essentially, inventiveness is the ability to take one or more newly discovered concepts and 
find a way to put them to practical use. The earliest inventions of mankind date back to ancient stone and metal tools used for hunting, 
digging, and other everyday tasks. After writing allowed the ideas of various civilizations to be exchanged and studied, mankind's inventions 
became increasingly more useful and innovative. Most inventions are geared toward improving or simplifying human existence in some way. 
Often, inventions themselves make it possible to make new discoveries, which then go on to inspire better and more innovative inventions.

^The principle behind printing is not very complicated, but immense amounts of complexity are invested in the mass production of printed 
documents. Invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, the early printing presses used a flat tray of inked type. Once paper 
was placed over the type, a surface was applied and the ink was pressed into the paper. While an improvement over the traditional 
duplication methods of the time (being meticulous hand-scribing of volumes), it was a slow and tedious process to use. Around 1800 the first 
cylinder press was created, followed by the large and immensely fast rotary presses. Today, computers have taken this ancient art out of the 
craftsman’s workshop and placed it on the desktop. Desktop publishing revolutionized the creation of printed documents, not only from the 
standpoint of speed and accuracy, but also by enabling anyone to mass-produce the printed word without investing the many years it takes 
to learn the trade. 


#DESC_TECH_Music_Theory

^Music finds a comfortable parallel with that of human language. Much as language has words, sentences, and stories, music has tones, 
melodies, and songs. The theory of music emphasizes the elements from which music is composed. One such structure is the melody, which 
is a grouping of musical notes that combine into a basic, but immensely flexible structure. Another is the chord, which is two or more notes 
played simultaneously to create a harmony. The impact of music throughout history can be clearly seen, as both entertainment and an art.

fundamental right in the United States. Schools of all types began to specialize in certain fields and/or student demographics, allowing people 
of all kinds the benefit of this wealth of information. Modern curriculums surprisingly cover many of the same subjects taught throughout

Gunpowder is believed to have been developed by the Chinese, who used it in fireworks as early as the 9th century, but it did not reach 
Europe until the 14th century. Europeans immediately saw the potential of this substance, and manufactured it for use in weapons as early as 
1334. The discovery of gunpowder led to the invention of firearms, such as the musket, which led to the replacement of archers in most 
armies of the world by the late 1500s. Gunpowder marked one of the major technological turning points in military history; significantly 
changing the way wars were fought.


#DESC_TECH_Banking
^
^
^Many of the services performed by banks today can be traced back to medieval Europe. Certain families, such as the Medicis of Italy, were 
known for the banking duties they performed. These wealthy merchants pooled their surplus money into a bank, then loaned cash (with 
interest) to other commercial enterprises. The availability of this capital for investment made many new businesses possible, accelerating 
economic growth. The first modern banks were established in Europe during the late 1600s. The primary function of today's banking system 
is the granting of loans to consumers and businesses. In addition to loaning money and safeguarding deposits, banks also invest in government 
and private securities and bonds. Both the loan and investment functions of banks not only make profits for the bank itself, but also stimulate 
the economy by providing funds for business growth and consumer purchases.

^Astronomy originated as simple observation and recording of regular celestial movements for the purpose of time keeping and determining 
directional bearings. The ancient Greeks were among the first to study astronomy in detail. They described the use of stars for navigation at 
sea, and recorded the position of constellations during each season of the year for purposes of determining times for planting and harvesting. 
The Greek astronomer Aristarchus developed the theory that celestial motion could be explained by the fact that the Earth revolved on its 
axis once every 24 hours, and revolves around the sun along with the other planets. This theory was rejected at the time, only to be 
rediscovered nearly 2000 years later by Copernicus. These early students of astronomy compiled data that became the cornerstone for 
modern astronomical research.


#DESC_TECH_Chemistry
^
^
^The earliest practical use of chemical processes was by metal smiths of the ancient world. These artisans learned how to use heat to melt 
various naturally occurring metals together to form alloys such as bronze. Early manufacturers of cloth also used primitive chemical processes 
to set dyes. In the following centuries, chemical processes were studied through the pseudo-science of alchemy, which attempted to change 
base metals into gold. Although alchemists were, of course, unsuccessful, they did develop many valuable chemical processes as a result. The
manuscripts produced by alchemists were studied by succeeding generations, and an effective knowledge of chemistry had been accumulated 
by the late 13th century. In the 17th century, the ideas of alchemy finally died out as an increasing body of true chemical knowledge was 
gained through experimental analysis, leading to the modern science of chemistry.


#DESC_TECH_Democracy
^
^
^Democracy is a ruling system where the citizens have a great deal of control over the actions of the government, either directly or through 
elected representatives. Democratic governments can be traced back to the city-states of ancient Greece and Rome. Citizens would gather 
in a public forum, and each one would have the opportunity to speak and vote on issues affecting the community. This direct democracy 
system was possible due to the relatively small populations of the city-states. Starting in the 17th century, the monarchs of Europe began to 
be stripped of their absolute power, and by the end of the 19th century the citizens had a strong voice in government in many European 
nations. Large populations made public forums impractical, so the people elected groups of representatives to carry their views to the ruling 
powers. Strictly speaking, this type of system more closely resembles a republican system rather than a true democracy. This type of 
representative democracy is considered the best governing system in the modern world because of the personal and economic freedom 
enjoyed by the citizens.

concepts in a more formal way. The first recorded study of economics as a science, rather than a philosophical or political concept, was the 
book "The Wealth of Nations" by Scottish economist Adam Smith. This book represents the first attempt to fully analyze sources of income 
and the distribution of wealth. Smith's analysis of economics served as a guide by which many of the governmental economic policies of the 
present day were formed.

^In the early days of seafaring, sailors operated solely through a process known as "piloting", in which the position and course of the ship was 
determined by referring to geographical landmarks. The need to stay in view of the shore severely limited the extent of sea voyages. Through 
experience, sailors learned to apply the science of astronomy to their profession, noting the positions and movement of particular stars. They 
realized that even when the shore was out of sight, they could steer by certain reliable stars. This crude, yet practical application of astronomy 
allowed the adventurous to sail into the unknown with a reasonable chance of finding their way. As a result, ship building technology quickly
improved, producing larger, more stable ships designed for longer voyages.


#DESC_TECH_Physics

^
^Physics is the study of the many forms of matter and energy and the way they interact with themselves and each other. A number of ancient 
races made observations about certain aspects of physics, such as planetary motion, but were unable to develop theories as to the reasons 
for these motions. Some of the earliest applications of physics were by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, who applied physics to create 
such devices as levers and screws. It was not until the 17th century that experimental methods and scientific measuring devices led to a true 
understanding of many fundamental physical laws. Early scientists such as Johannes Kepler and Sir Isaac Newton began to disprove the 
theories of the ancient Greek philosophers and scientifically prove their theories concerning the laws of physics. Discoveries in physics rarely 
have direct applications, however they do provide a basic understanding of the laws governing the universe, thus forming the basis for practical 
advances in technology.

^Metallurgy is the study of the properties of metals and the methods used to separate metal deposits from metal-bearing ores. Through the 
course of history, artisans have switched the materials from which they constructed weapons and tools to harder, more durable metals as they 
were discovered. However, metallurgy as a science wasn't studied in earnest until the powers of Europe began to compete against one 
another in an attempt to design better and more effective weapons starting around the 14th century. Constant improvements in metallurgy led 
to the discovery of new metals and alloys that were stronger, lighter, and cheaper. As a result of this race for military dominance, Europeans 
produced some of the most advanced weaponry in the world during this time period.

#DESC_TECH_Theory_of_Gravity

^In the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton developed the law of universal gravitation. This law recognized that every mass in the universe exerts 
an attraction on every other mass. Newton postulated that gravity was a universal force that affected all matter. Newton's theory served to 
explain the forces of attraction between the Earth and nearby objects, as well as the forces that affect the motion of planets and other 
astronomical bodies. In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity led to a major reinterpretation and clarification of 
Newton's theory of gravity. Scientists now believe that gravity affects energy as well as matter, and that gravity is actually a fundamental 
warping of the fabric of space-time. Some theorize that the force of this warping is transmitted by as-yet-unobserved particles called 
gravitons.

^
^The ancient Greeks, Romans, and Chinese knew the phenomenon of magnetism. They observed that lodestone, an iron-bearing ore, 
attracted other iron. They also noted that pieces of iron that came into contact with lodestone gained magnetic properties as well. The 
electromagnetic force of attraction and repulsion between various substances is due to the motion of positively and negatively charged 
electrons. Every magnet has positive and negative sides, called poles. Poles with a like charge repel one another, and poles with opposite 
charges attract one another. The study of magnetic phenomena soon showed that a free-floating magnet aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic 
field, one pole pointing north, the other south. This was an important discovery, and led to the invention of the compass in the early 13th 
century. The use of the compass revolutionized sea travel by reducing the reliance on landmarks and stars for navigation.

^With the fall of the feudal system in Europe and the creation of standing armies, a new military tradition was born. 
Organizing soldiers based on their skill, experience, and understanding of tactics rather than their position of birth, 
the armies of post feudal Europe were markedly different from their predecessors. This change in the position of warfare 
also necessitated a change in the definition of the soldier, and with this transformation also came a strict code of conduct 
based on the old ideals of chivalry. The life of a professional soldier came to appeal to many who saw it as a career filled 
with opportunity for advancement, and now ordinary citizens were able to distinguish themselves in any number of specialized 
positions in military conflict. The European military tradition arguably reached its highest point during the reign of 
Napoleon Bonaparte in France when, through military might, France gained control of the majority of European soil.

important to know that nationalism can come in a variety of forms, some permutations bearing little resemblance to each other. Many early 
nationalistic leaders preached the superiority of their country over all others. While this type isn’t extinct today (as evidenced by the

^The steam engine is a device that uses steam to generate power. Water, heated by burning fuel (usually coal or wood), turns to steam. The 
steam is contained in a chamber where it builds up pressure, causing a piston to move. The piston drives a turbine, the rotation of which 
produces power, which can be use for such purposes as producing motion or generating electricity. The early principles of this device were 
understood as early as the late 17th century, but it wasn't until 1769 that Scottish engineer James Watt patented a practical design for what 
was to become the basis for the modern steam engine. The invention of the steam engine led to a number of landmark developments, 
including the steam locomotive and the earliest examples of automobiles. Steam engines remained the chief means of motive power in the
transportation industry until the invention of the more powerful and compact internal combustion engine. Steam turbines are still in use today 
in a number of applications including the generation of electrical power.

^Primitive man attributed the onset of serious disease as the influence of the gods, or possession by evil spirits. Over time, however, it was 
found that such "possessions" could be treated through the use of elixirs made from plant extracts. Methods were also developed to clean 
and treat wounds, and set fractured bones. The ancient Greeks established the first schools to teach medical sciences circa 500 BC. The 
texts produced by the students of these schools, most notably Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, based his theories of 
the human body on observation and reasoning rather than supernatural intervention. Continued study of diseases over the years, combined 
with the dissection and study of the human body in the 13th century, pointed out flaws in early Greek theories, and led to more accurate 
medical texts based on detailed analysis rather than conjecture. By the 18th century, the same methods of analysis and observation used by 
scientists in other fields were applied to the study of medicine. This paved the way for the increasingly effective methods of treatment and 
surgery that have prevailed over the last 200 years.


#DESC_TECH_Communism
^
^
^Communism is a conceptualized system of government in which resources and production facilities are the property of the entire society 
rather than individuals. In a communist society, labor is shared equally as well, and the benefits of labor are distributed according to need. 
Under such a system, all people would be equal, without class stratification. Although the basic idea of communism has existed since the time 
of Plato, modern communism is identified with the system of government described by Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels in the "Communist 
Manifesto". They believed that capitalistic systems, in which the rich upper class prospered through the exploitation of the powerless lower 
class, were bound to destroy themselves. At this point, the poor would rebel against their former oppressors and form a classless society. 
This prophecy has never come true, and countries that have attempted to base their governments on communism have ultimately failed to 
achieve the utopia described by Marx and Engels.

product to the consumers.  Industrialization revolutionized living standards, both positively and negatively. The rapid growth of production 
industries and the reduced cost of production have led to the prosperity of some of the richest families in history. Industrialization has also led 
to the creation of a blue-collar working class. In newly industrialized nations, these workers, skilled only in their chosen trade, were often

^Mankind has always pursued an understanding of the universe that surrounds them. The scientific method lays down the blueprints for 
transmuting a theory into scientific law. The first step is to identify a process or phenomenon and begin to gather information about it. From 
this data, the scientist forms a hypothesis about the workings of the process observed. They then proceed to run a series of experiments to 
gather additional information that substantiates or disproves their theory. If the theory can co-exist with the findings, it can then be called a 
scientific law. Which is not to say that it cannot be disproved, as many such laws have become false as technology and new ideas are brought

enemy. Although every world government has strict laws and penalties to deal with spies, covert intelligence is an important political, 
technological, and military commodity. During times of war, covert operatives provide important information about enemy troop movements 
and weapons technology. Spies may also be called upon to perform acts of sabotage in order to delay or divert the enemy. In peacetime,

the business to investors. This arrangement allows the business to expand rapidly, while spreading the risks of the expansion among many 
people, reducing individual risk. Corporations also have legal advantages such as the right to sue, and the limitation of liability for the 
corporation's debt to the amount originally invested by the owners. Corporations as legal entities have existed since ancient Rome, although 
the joint-stock company as it is known today didn't begin operating until sometime in the 16th century.

including kerosene and gasoline. As consumer demand continued to increase, commercial refineries were set up to purify crude oil. The new 
petroleum products produced as a result of the development and perfection of the refining process led to the use of oil-based fuels in many

^The iron alloys produced up until about the 14th century were made by heating a mixture of iron ore and charcoal in a forge, then pounding 
the molten metal to drive out the impurities or "slag". Occasionally, the iron mixture would absorb more carbon, creating steel rather than 
wrought iron. Because steel proved to be less brittle and more resistant to corrosion than iron, techniques were developed to produce steel. 
Blowing a coal derivative called coke through molten iron did this. Most modern steel making utilizes the "blast furnace", developed by Henry 
Bessemer in 1855, to accomplish this task on a large-scale basis. The strength and other qualities of steel make it the material of choice for

theory proceeded slowly. Experimental scientists of the 16th and 17th centuries developed methods of analyzing gases, liquids, and solids to 
determine the individual elements of which they were composed. The founder of modern atomic theory was British chemist John Dalton. 
Dalton's experiments explained how atoms link together to form molecules. He also explained the nature of these chemical bonds, and 
performed a number of experiments concerning the formation of various chemical compounds.

^The development of internal combustion was a great advance of the Industrial Age. German engineer Nikolaus Otto built the forerunner 
of today’s internal combustion engine in 1876. Refinements on Otto's design over the next ten years led to more efficient and powerful 
engines. The internal combustion engine forever changed world transportation. Early automobiles utilizing steam engines had proven to be 
both underpowered and impractical, but the fuel efficiency and compact size of the internal combustion engine allowed the automotive 
industry to flourish. Several variations, including the diesel engine designed by Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel, went on to revolutionize 
propulsion in shipping and other transportation industries.


#DESC_TECH_Mass_Production
^
^
^The industrial revolution redefined the very concepts of manufacturing and changed the way goods were produced. One such 
concept was that of mass production, which utilized the benefits of machine made replaceable parts to their greatest 
advantage. In 1914 Henry Ford, the father of the assembly line, realized that by making a moving line on which automobiles 
moved and giving each person on the line a series of specialized tasks they would be able to make cars cheaply and more 
efficiently. This concept of mass production revolutionized the automotive industry. The time it took to turn out a Model T 
in the factory went from 728 minutes to 98 minutes; this time was eventually to drop to one Model T every 24 seconds. The 
idea quickly spread, and by the time America entered World War I in 1917 the assembly line had been adapted by all US 
military manufacturing plants and shipyards. Mass production techniques developed in the early 1900s transformed the 
American landscape from a rural population into an urban one, and changed all industrialized nations, for better or for 
worse, forever.

^With the advent of machine manufacturing, craftsmen were able to set manufacturing to exacting specifications. One 
advantage of this was being able to manufacture complex objects, such as guns, in separate pieces. The benefit of this was 
realized when manufacturers replaced only the broken parts of the objects that they made rather than replacing or repairing 
the entire instrument. By setting machine manufacturing guidelines, manufacturers were able to make large quantities of the 
components of their products and then later assemble the finished product, increasing efficiency greatly. Replaceable parts 
revolutionized nearly every industry in the industrial age, paving the way for mass production and assembly line manufacture.

16th century, Leonardo da Vinci proposed a number of inventions that eventually came to pass, including the propeller and the parachute. 
Throughout the 19th century, various engineers experimented successfully with gliders, and experiments with compressed air and steam 
engines attempted to produce self-powered flight with limited success. The key to success in powered flight was the invention of the internal 
combustion engine. Just after the turn of the 20th century, Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first four controlled, sustained human flights at 
Kitty Hawk, NC. The technology of flight advanced rapidly from this landmark event, and within a relatively few years, aircraft were circling 
the globe, safely delivering passengers and mail at record speeds.


#DESC_TECH_Amphibious_Warfare
^
^
^A combined land and sea attack, usually associated with the capture of a beachhead or coastal area, is known as amphibious warfare. First 
attempted by the ancient Persians during the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, successful coordination of amphibious assaults are considered to 
be among the most complex military operations. When ship-mounted guns were developed, naval vessels would open fire on ground forces 
and gun emplacements while merchant ships were used to land troops and supplies. The first modern amphibious assault took place at 
Gallipoli during World War I. Poorly planned and executed, this assault failed, but served as an example of the need for perfect coordination 
of forces in this type of attack. As battlefield communications improved, and the range of ship-mounted weapons increased, amphibious 
warfare became increasingly successful, and played a vital role in World War II. Today, amphibious operations are augmented by fast, 
armored landing vehicles; hovercraft that are capable of moving troops to and across the beach; and airborne assistance from planes and 
helicopters.


#DESC_TECH_Electronics
^
^
^The field of electronics deals with the practical application and manipulation of electricity and electromagnetic phenomena. The invention of 
the vacuum tube in the early 20th century marked the beginning of modern electronics. The vacuum tube was capable of amplifying weak 
radio signals, allowing them to be transmitted over greater distances. Vacuum tubes also allowed music and voice to be superimposed onto
radio waves for transmission. The early study of electronics revolutionized a number of fields, especially the field of communications. 
Because of the vacuum tube, the technology of radio communications was highly developed by World War II. After the war, electronics 
research continued to advance rapidly. Post-war advances include the earliest examples of digital computers and, eventually, transistors and 
integrated circuits: miniaturized replacements for the vacuum tube.


#DESC_TECH_Motorized_Transportation
^
^
^The earliest attempts at producing a self-propelled vehicle date back to the late 1770s. These early vehicles used bulky steam engines for 
power. Despite constant improvements, the steam engine ultimately proved impractical for small vehicles. The development of the internal 
combustion engine in the late 1800s provided a small but powerful replacement for steam engines, and was able to achieve much higher 
speeds. The first practical automobiles were developed in the late 19th century, by automotive pioneers in France, Germany, and the United 
States. By the 1920s, a number of automotive manufacturing companies were operating in the U.S., including Ford and General Motors. By 
1980, more than 300 million cars and 85 million trucks were in operation throughout the world. The popularity of the automobile has led to 
massive improvements in the highway systems in most industrialized countries. Unfortunately, automobiles are also one of the primary sources 
of air pollution, and have resulted in an all time high demand for petrochemical fuels.

^During World War II and in the years that followed, great leaps were made in the field of aviation. The military
demands of the war necessitated the development of aircraft designed for long-range bombing, and for the transportation
of troops and equipment. Although advances in aviation were made all over the world during this time, the Germans were
particularly adept in the development of advanced flight technologies. In 1944, they developed the V-2, the first truly
guided missile, capable of delivering 2000 pounds of explosives to targets nearly 200 miles away. The Germans also
developed the Me 262, the first jet fighter plane, which was first used in 1945. Although both the V-2 and the Me 262
came too late to affect the outcome of World War II, both of these advances paved the way for the advanced flight
technologies of today.

^Prior to Guglielmo Marconi's invention of the radio in 1896, long-distance communication was carried out either by mail or over miles of 
cable via telegraph. Marconi's first demonstration of the radiotelegraph transmitted a message just over one mile without the use of wires. 
Continued improvements increased transmission range to over 200 miles by early 1901, and by the end of the year a single letter ("A") had 
been transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean. By 1905, many ships were equipped with radiotelegraphs for ship-to-ship and ship-to-land 
communications, and by 1915 the invention of the three-element vacuum tube, or triode, made it possible to regularly transmit voice messages 
over the airwaves. Throughout the years, radio has been refined not only for communication, but for detection and ranging (Radar) and 
astronomy.

^Rockets are projectiles that are propelled by the expulsion of gases generated in a combustion chamber. The first solid-fuel rockets, invented 
by the Chinese in the 13th century, used a mixture similar to gunpowder for fuel. Although rockets were used in warfare to set fire to buildings 
and the sails of ships for nearly 500 years, it wasn't until the early 19th century that the first crude explosive rockets were used in battle. 
Research and design efforts by scientists such as Robert Goddard in the 20th century refined rocket design to produce faster, better 
controlled rockets. During World War II, this new technology was used to create the German V-2, the first true guided missile. 
Scientific developments since World War II have been applied to adapt the rocket for use in even more powerful and accurate weapons with 
incredible range. The rocket is also used in peaceful application such as the launch of satellites and the exploration of space.

^According to Einstein's theory of relativity, even the smallest bit of matter is equivalent to a tremendous amount of energy. For instance, two 
pounds of matter, if converted completely into energy, would produce energy equivalent to the explosive force of 22 megatons of high 
explosives. In 1939, based on German experiments that successfully split the uranium atom, physicists were able to explain the process of 
nuclear fission.  When a large, unstable atomic nucleus splits (fissions) it results in two or more smaller, more stable nuclei accompanied by 
the release of tremendous amounts of energy and lingering, deadly radioactivity. The first application of this powerful technology was in 
warfare. A top-secret research effort in the U.S. known as the Manhattan Project studied the fission process, and eventually produced the 
first atomic bombs, which were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. These relatively small bombs, the only 
atomic weapons ever used in a war, each produced an explosion equivalent to more than 20,000 tons of TNT. The nuclear weapons of 
today are capable of producing explosions thousands of times more powerful.


#DESC_TECH_Computers

^
^A computer is a device capable of performing a series of repetitive arithmetic or logical functions far more quickly than the human brain. The 
earliest computers were designed to solve complex mathematical equations. British mathematician Charles Babbage conceived such a 
machine, called the Analytical Engine, in the 19th century. Many variations of analog, or mechanical, computing devices were built during the 
first half of the 20th century, and were used for such tasks as computing torpedo tracking in submarines and controlling bombsights. The 
growing study of electronics in the late 1940s led to the invention of the digital computer. The first all-electronic computer, containing 18,000 
vacuum tubes and capable of hundreds of multiplications per minute, was built in 1946. Further advances in electronics rapidly reduced the 
size and increased the speed and efficiency of computers. Today, computers are commonplace, and are used in virtually every field of 
endeavor. Significant advances in computer technology continue to take place at an amazing pace.

^Increasing world population has led to an inevitable increase in the amount of garbage produced by society. Conventional disposal methods, 
such as burial in a landfill, have proven inadequate to handle the growing waste problem. One solution to this problem is the reuse of 
discarded materials through recycling. Although scrap metals and other materials have been reused in manufacturing processes for some time, 
true recycling is a broad-based, household-by-household effort. The increasing pollution generated by industry and consumerism, added to 
the depletion of natural resources, make the re-use of materials less a concern of efficiency and more as one of necessity for the survival of 
the human species. Not only does the recycling of waste materials prevent the unwanted build-up of garbage, it saves energy and slows the 
depletion of natural resources such as trees and petroleum products.


#DESC_TECH_Space_Flight

^
^Utilizing the now well-developed science of rocketry, the modern exploration of space began in October 1957 when the Soviet Union 
launched Sputnik one. This tiny satellite orbited the earth for 57 days, providing information on radiation and other phenomena in the upper 
atmosphere. In less than a year, the United States had also launched a satellite, Explorer one. This started the "space race", years of competition 
between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to achieve new frontiers in space exploration. Space flight advanced rapidly from the simple sub-orbital 
flights of the 1950s, to manned missions to Earth's moon in the late 1960s. The rapid growth of space technology led to many practical 
applications, such as weather and surveillance satellites, and vastly improved worldwide communications. Today, although hindered by severe 
government budget cuts, the exploration of space continues. Plans in the near future call for continued orbital exploration via the space shuttle 
program, and the eventual construction of the multi-national, manned space station "Freedom" in the early 21st century.


#DESC_TECH_Nuclear_Power
^
^
^In addition to its potential for destruction, the energy released in nuclear fission was seen as a potential source of controlled power generation. 
By 1944, large-scale nuclear reactors were in operation for the production of plutonium, although the energy produced by these reactors was 
not used. Following World War II, increased efforts were turned toward the extensive use of nuclear power to produce electricity. Nuclear 
power plants use the radiant energy of a controlled nuclear reaction to heat water, converting it to steam to spin turbines that generate 
electricity. The major drawback to nuclear fission is the lack of a safe means of disposal for the waste produced by the reaction, which 
retains its lethal radioactivity for hundreds of years. Another hazard is the possibility of a malfunction in the reactor that could lead to a 
meltdown of the core. Despite massive safety precautions, human error and equipment failures can lead to devastating accidents such as the 
explosion at Chernobyl in 1986, in which at least 30 people were killed and thousands lost their homes and face possible long-term illness 
after exposure to near-lethal doses of radiation. Because of growing public concern, the development of new nuclear power plants has 
slowed as scientists search for viable solutions to these problems.


#DESC_TECH_Superconductor
^
^
^Any material through which an electrical current can pass with relatively little resistance is known as a conductor. When an electric current 
passes through most conductors, part of that current is lost due to resistance, which varies depending on the conducting material and the 
ambient temperature. Some conductors, when cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, lose all resistance to current. These are known as 
superconductors. Because no energy is lost to resistance, superconductors can lead to a wide variety of practical uses. These include 
super-fast computers, powerful electromagnetic fields strong enough to contain fusion reactions, and the completely efficient generation and 
transmission of electrical power. Although the extremely low temperatures necessary to produce superconductivity have limited its uses thus 
far, recent developments hint that some unusual materials may be super conductive even at room temperatures. The isolation and large-scale 
production of these materials could lead to a new revolution in the field of electronics.


#DESC_TECH_Miniaturization
^
^
^Early radios and other electronic devices relied on vacuum tube technology. Because the tubes took up a great deal of space, the devices that 
utilized them tended to be very bulky and cumbersome. In the late 1940s, the development of the transistor provided a compact alternative to 
vacuum tubes. Transistors were capable of achieving the same level of power amplification achieved by tubes while taking up much less space,
and using only a fraction of the power. Starting in the 1960s, the integrated circuit provided still another level of miniaturization. An integrated 
circuit the size of a transistor could perform the function of 20 transistors. Today, the microprocessor, a modern refinement of the original 
integrated circuits, can incorporate the functions of several complete printed circuit boards into a single, low-power consumption chip less 
than two inches square, allowing for the construction of hand-held computers with more computing power than the huge mainframes used in 
the 70s and 80s.

^For centuries, human society has taken the gifts of nature for granted. As civilizations grew, humans spread out across the face of the planet, 
taking what they needed from the land and producing more and more waste materials with little regard for the future. In the late 1960s, a 
growing number of people became concerned about the growing problems of pollution and the destruction of natural habitats. This movement 
led to the formation of groups like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA's aim is to reduce all types of pollution. To this end, 
the agency has imposed strict laws and guidelines concerning the disposal of hazardous materials, set clean water standards, and studied more 
effective techniques of solid waste disposal. The primary goal of the environmental movement as a whole is to make sure that the environment 
is safe and intact for future generations to enjoy.

^Artificial satellites are spacecraft that maintain an orbit around a celestial body. What differentiates an orbit from other types of space flight is it 
doesn’t require any additional propulsion. Satellites can hold a number of different orbits. One type is a polar orbit, which causes the 
spacecraft to pass over the north and south poles. Another is an equatorial orbit, which causes the satellite to circle the Earth’s equator. The 
farther the orbit from the surface of the earth, the longer it takes to complete a circuit of the earth. If the vessel uses an equatorial orbit at a 
distance of 22,300 miles from Earth, it can achieve geo-synchronous orbit, which causes the satellite to remain stationary over a specific area. 
The first satellite was the Soviet Union vehicle Sputnik 1, which was launched in October 1957. Today satellites fulfill many roles, including 
scientific research, weather forecasting, personal and business communication, and military intelligence gathering.

emission of light in 1917. The first helium-neon gas laser was built in 1961. Years of research and development have led to a wide variety of 
laser applications in many different fields. Lasers can be used for everything from the precision cutting of almost any material and performing 
microsurgery to reading digital data and music information off of a compact disc. The military currently uses lasers for weapons targeting

#DESC_TECH_Genetics

^The field of genetics involves the manipulation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contains the genetic "code" which determines the 
inherited traits of living organisms. Removing a section of an organism’s DNA and replacing it with that of another organism can alter the 
characteristics of the organism. Since its inception, genetic engineering has produced a number of important benefits, such as isolating the 
gene for interferon, a rare substance that may be of great value in the treatment of viral diseases and cancer. Genetic manipulation may 
someday also provide a cure for birth defects and inherited diseases. Unfortunately, there are also potential dangers involved in this 
technology. Genetically engineered diseases, more communicable and virulent than any occurring in nature, could potentially be created in the 
laboratory by accident or maliciously. Such viruses could be used as a dreadful biological weapon. Domestic and international regulations 
regarding genetic experimentation exist to prevent such a situation from occurring.


#DESC_TECH_Stealth
^
^
^It has long been recognized that in warfare, the best advantage available is surprise. If one can approach an enemy undetected, the attack has 
a better chance of being successful. The widespread use of radar starting in World War II greatly decreased the possibility of surprise for an 
airborne assault. Planes could be detected from miles away, giving the enemy a chance to prepare for the attack. Over the years, the military 
has employed many different approaches to solve this problem. The most recent development is "Stealth" technology. Stealth planes are 
painted with radar-absorbing paint, and designed in such a way as to minimize the number of angular surfaces from which an enemy can 
bounce a radar signal. The engines are also hooded to reduce the plane's heat signature. The result is an aircraft capable of approaching an 
enemy target, launching an attack, and returning to base with little chance of detection. The F-117A Stealth Fighter was used with great 
effectiveness by US forces in the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

^Smart weapons are those that utilize targeting mechanisms external to it. A good example of this is the ‘Maverick’ munitions, which 
use a separate laser to ‘designate’ the bomb’s target. The source of this laser can be a plane, a soldier close to the target, or even an orbiting 
satellite. With the target ‘painted’ by this laser, the Maverick can adjust and refine its path to the target based on the laser’s reflection. 
Another type of smart weapon is one that uses a TV camera to feed visual information to a human technician. Using this information they 
could make small or great course changes throughout the flight, right up until impact. A benefit of both these types of guidance is extreme 
precision. Since many modern conflicts  take place among non-combatants, these high tech weapons can ensure that only the 
actual target is affected by the attack.

tasks more quickly than humans. Experimental robots capable of simple manipulation of objects were in operation by the late 1960s. 
General Motors commissioned the first robots used on an assembly line in the 1970s. Constant improvements in the computer field have

^The threat of nuclear war became the backdrop of world politics after World War II. This terror sparked a fifty year long 
conflict, the Cold War, between the two leading super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States. Although there was no 
direct armed conflict between these two nations, the conflicts fought over their opposing ideologies often served to 
heighten tensions and fears of a nuclear holocaust, from which nothing might have emerged. Integrated defense was a concept 
born of the Cold War. Using satellite intelligence and laser designation, it was believed, a shield could be erected to 
pinpoint and destroy all high altitude threats through lasers or missiles. Although no such defense shield was ever erected, 
the theory behind a national anti missile shield still remains a viable option, especially against a "rogue state" scenario 
in which there are a very small number of inbound targets to eliminate.

Ship builders therefore began adding iron plates to the above-water sides of their ships, and the ironclad steamships were born. The French launched the first seagoing ironclad, La Gloire, in 1859. The first battle between ironclads occurred in 1862 during the American Civil War when the CSS Virginia fought the USS Monitor inconclusively for four hours. The Monitor featured a steam-driven gun turret that sat on a flat armored deck. Designed by John Ericsson as a coastal and riverine warship, the Monitor sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras at the end of that year, but her sister ships performed admirably in the US Navy's blockade of Southern ports.

^	Some common elements of fascism include strong nationalist sentiment, xenophobia, subordination of individual interests to the community, militarism and glorification of the army, secret police forces that enforce secret laws, informer networks, suppression of civil liberties and independent media, and economic policies that tightly tie business and commerce to government. (Note that many of these features are common in communist states as well.)
^	Fascist states need not be authoritarian, although they usually are; when fascist leaders are democratically elected (as Adolf Hitler was), they often try to modify or abolish the democratic institutions that placed the leaders in power.

^Arguably the most useful domesticated animal in mankind’s history, horses have existed for some 50 million years. While significant 
evolution has taken place (early ancestors were under a foot tall), the basic appearance of horses has remained relatively 
unchanged. The earliest interaction between horses and men was of game, with early man hunting them for food. Around 2500 
B.C. the first signs of domesticated breeds began appearing in Asia, but the idea took hold and spread rapidly. Their contributions 
to man’s conquest of his fellow man were immense, enabling the vast campaigns by Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. 
The Spaniards introduced the modern breed to North America in the 16th century, often turning their imported herds loose

plant matter hardened and became coal. Coal deposits are mined all over the world, and coal was one of the major fuel sources 
in the world through the 1970s. In many countries, concern over the environmental effects of the burning of coal has led to a 
decline in its use. The smoke produced by burning coal has a high acid content, and creates an environmental condition known 
as acid rain, which is harmful to plant and animal life. Despite the environmental concerns, some of the largest coal mines in the 
U.S. each still produce more than 450,000 metric tons annually, making coal mining a very profitable industry.

^Humans have known oil since ancient times. Oil deposits found on the surface were used for centuries for waterproofing and 
fuel purposes. But it was not until the coming of the Industrial Revolution that civilizations began to form a dependence on 
petroleum products. The widespread use of oil for fuel, lubrication, and other purposes led to a search for larger supplies. In 
the mid 1800s, the first oil wells were drilled, marking the beginning of a tremendously important and profitable industry. Today, 
with the world’s oil supplies dwindling and the demand for oil constantly rising, oil is a more valuable resource than ever.

^Rubber was a common resource for the Indians of Central and South America since well before Columbus landed in the New 
World. This naturally occurring rubber allowed waterproofed shoes, playing balls, and other pragmatic benefits, but had the 
problem of shortly losing its elasticity. The process of vulcanizing, discovered accidentally by Charles Goodyear in 1839, 
improved not only its elasticity but also its ability to stay pliable in hot or cold weather. The first synthetic rubbers began appearing 
towards the end of the 19th century in Europe. Though they were of limited benefit (because of inferior quality compared to 
natural rubber) one advantage was independence from having to import the material from regional plantations. The Germans 
learned this lesson well during World War I, when the British Navy shut down many of their naval shipping routes.

^A silvery, gray metal, aluminum has a staggering number of uses and applications. Just a few examples include the fact it never 
rusts, is lighter than copper (and almost as effective in electricity transmission), and is soft enough to easily mold for nearly any 
purpose. Though the dominant metal in the Earth’s composition, aluminum wasn’t discovered until 1825, thousands of years 
after copper and iron. The primary reason for this was the difficulty in extracting the metal from the ore (in modern aluminum, 
the ore bauxite). Charles Hall, a 22-year-old American, created what was to become the most cost effective method of 
separating aluminum in 1886. His process involved passing an electrical current through aluminum oxide, resulting in two 
separate components of pure aluminum and oxygen.

^One of the most valuable metals in the world, uranium’s use has dramatically changed since its discovery in 1789. Originally 
used in the production of steel-alloys, uranium improved the strength and elasticity of steel without making it brittle. Since 1939 it’s rarely been 
used for anything besides atomic energy. This heavy, white metal’s greatest contribution is to the process of nuclear fission. 
Radioactive manipulation of uranium atoms can eject neutrons, which can travel at speeds up to 12,000 miles per second. If 
such a neutron impacts the nucleus of a neighboring atom, the target atom can completely fragment. Not only is the resulting 
energy released immense, but the shattered atom can also potentially collide with additional atoms. This chain reaction is 
the phenomenon underlying all nuclear fission applications including nuclear weapons and power.

color of silk, wool and cotton to be enhanced with a varied spectrum of color. Natural dyes are created from a myriad of 
sources, including shells, animals and plants, though these were not always permanent and frequently expensive. Modern dyes 
are based around artificial or processed substances such as coal and other chemicals. One benefit for a nation with an extensive 
dye industry is that the processes involved in creating dye can be easily retooled to other purposes. Germany discovered this in

In areas such as the Pacific coast of Central and South America, offshore winds push the warm surface waters out to deeper 
waters. Underwater currents push cold, nutrient-rich water from deep below the surface back toward the coast. The high

examples of commonly grown plants in oases. To desert cultures of old, oases were of vital importance as sites
for agriculture, trading and manufacturing, and the cultures that frequented oases often established rigid codes
of conduct regarding them. No one would be allowed to despoil an oasis, and if the unthinkable should happen, the
penalty was often death. Most oases in the Arabian Peninsula became sites for shrines, and this added sanctity
also brought about a further code of conduct, namely no one could shed blood at the oasis where the shrine was
located. This allowed the often-warring tribes of Arabia neutral territory in which to trade or conduct peace
negotiations. The Silk Road was mostly a series of oases across the forbidding territory of central Asia between
China and the Middle East. Mecca, Cairo and Baghdad are examples of cities that originated because of an oasis,

^Mountains are formed when 
the plates making up the Earth's crust impact or slide against one another, raising layers of rock above the surrounding land. 
Mountains can also be formed by volcanic action, or through the effects of erosion. Generally poor agricultural regions, mountains 
are often a source of great mineral wealth, with large deposits of gold and other valuable ores. Aside from their economic value, 
mountains provide a natural defensive barrier, shielding human settlements from invaders. Extensive mountain ranges can also 
greatly affect the weather patterns of a region by blocking and diverting wind and storms.

^There are 
several different types of forest, determined primarily by climate and the type of vegetation they contain. Forests of some type 
exist on nearly every continent in the world. Forests are a valuable source of natural resources, providing wood for paper 
products, building, and other purposes. The harvesting of trees must be done carefully, however. If not done in moderation, 
lumbering can destroy the natural habitat for indigenous animal species, and destroy the ecology of the land. Government 
regulations limiting the amount of trees that can be cut, and requiring the lumber industry to plant new trees to replace what they 
have harvested, help to prevent major ecological damage as a result of deforestation.

^In heavily forested areas where rainfall is high, the growth of both trees and other indigenous plants is profuse. The dense, tangled 
environment of the jungle is home to wide varieties of plant and animal life. Although mineral deposits and fruit-bearing plants can 
sometimes be found in these regions, jungles tend to lack both mineral and food resources. This, combined with the sheer density 
of the native plant life, makes jungles inhospitable to humans. In order to make these areas more useful, jungles are often 
destroyed through deforestation and burning to yield areas of grassland. While this improves the usefulness of the land for humans, 
it destroys the habitat of the indigenous animals of the region. It is estimated that hundreds of undiscovered species of insect and 
animal life are made extinct every day as a result of the destruction of jungles and rain forests.

^Heat rises. This is the reason, in a nutshell, for the presence of volcanoes on the earth. Mountainous
manifestations of vents and cracks in the earth's crust, volcanoes provide release for the heat that builds up
in the earth's core. A volcanic eruption occurs when the heat pressure underneath a particular vent becomes
too strong for the crust to contain, and depending on the size of the vent and the amount of pressure an
eruption can be minor (just a dribble of lava that seals off the volcano when it dries) or cataclysmic
(such as the Krakatoa or Vesuvius eruptions).

#DESC_GOVT_Anarchy
^Change of rule in cultures are often periods of unrest, but when the very framework for government is transformed 
it almost always results in a period of anarchy. The massive political and social upheaval experienced by the 
culture during a period of anarchy brings commerce and production to a standstill as cities rise up and government 
organizations try to restructure. Despite the fact that corruption and waste are absolute, there is a positive side 
to anarchy - it is temporary. When the smoke clears and the citizens calm down they are ready to embrace a new form 
of order in your society.

#DESC_GOVT_Despotism
^Despotism is, without a doubt, the simplest form of government. It is based on a simple concept: might makes 
right. In a despotism, the power is held unquestionably by those who hold power over the military and who therefore 
can enforce their decrees. Because of the oppression experienced in this type of regime, despots often find that 
their ability to control the population is proportional to their use of armed troops in towns and cities in which 
the people live. Furthermore, because it is such a centralized form of government despotism makes it difficult to 
effectively put down rebellions and prevent the misappropriation of funds if their empire grows too large. Despots 
pay a terrible price in waste and corruption in their society; and with the development of more sophisticated forms 
of government despots often find that staging a coup is necessary for further growth.

#DESC_GOVT_Monarchy
^Rule by monarchy developed as a logical extension of the absolute rule of tribal chieftains. Many of the earliest monarchs, such as those in 
ancient Egypt, claimed that they ruled by divine right. In the spread of European monarchy during the Middle Ages, however, rulership was 
generally conveyed upon a leader who could most effectively raise and command an army. Monarchies are dynastic, with rule of the country 
passing to the eldest son when the king dies or retires. Monarchs had absolute rule over their subjects, severely limiting the personal and 
economic freedom of all citizens except for nobility and the rich upper class. Although monarchies ruled most of Europe for centuries, the 
unhappiness of lower-class citizens eventually grew intolerable, causing several major revolutions. By the mid-18th century, the power of the 
European monarchs had been severely limited, paving the way for participatory systems of government.

#DESC_GOVT_Communism
Communism is a conceptualized system of government in which resources and production facilities are the property
of the entire society rather than individuals. In a communist society, labor is shared equally as well, and the
benefits of labor are distributed according to need. Under such a system, all people would be equal, without class stratification. Although the basic idea of 
communism has existed since the time of Plato, modern communism is identified with the system of government described by 
Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels in the "Communist Manifesto". They believed that capitalistic systems, in which the rich upper 
class prospered through the exploitation of the powerless lower class, were bound to destroy themselves. At this point, the poor 
would rebel against their former oppressors and form a classless society. This prophecy has never come true, and countries that 
have attempted to base their governments on communism have ultimately failed to achieve the utopia described by Marx and 
Engels.

#DESC_GOVT_Republic
The republic is a system of government in which the citizens appoint, by popular vote, a head of state and officials to represent the 
views of the general public. The concept of the republic first appeared in ancient Rome, where local provinces sent elected 
representatives to the Senate, which governed all Roman lands. Both the head of state and the local representatives in a republic 
are elected; no one is granted a position by birth or divine right. Republican governments are similar in some ways to democracies, 
in that they offer a great deal of personal, financial, and political freedom to their citizens. The main difference between the two 
systems is that a true democracy allows the participation of every voting citizen in any and all political matters, whereas in a 
republic, a body of elected officials represents the views and opinions of the people. Although an effective system, personal 
agendas of political representatives might act to decrease the effectiveness in representing the views of the people. Due to human 
nature, corruption is fairly common in a republican government.

#DESC_GOVT_Democracy
Democracy is a ruling system where the citizens have a great deal of control over the actions of the government, either directly or 
through elected representatives. Democratic governments can be traced back to the city-states of ancient Greece and Rome. 
Citizens would gather in a public forum, and each one would have the opportunity to speak and vote on issues affecting the 
community. This direct democracy system was possible due to the relatively small populations of the city-states. Starting in the 
17th century, the monarchs of Europe began to be stripped of their absolute power, and by the end of the 19th century the 
citizens had a strong voice in government in many European nations. Large populations made public forums impractical, so the 
people elected groups of representatives to carry their views to the ruling powers. Strictly speaking, this type of system more 
closely resembles a republican system rather than a true democracy. This type of representative democracy is considered the best 
governing system in the modern world because of the personal and economic freedom enjoyed by the citizens.

^
^
^Unlike other forms of government, there is no concrete definition of fascism. The word "fascism" comes from the fasces, the bundle of sticks used as a symbol of authority in ancient Rome -- appropriately, since the first fascist government, that of Benito Mussolini in Italy, aspired to regain Rome's glory.
^	Some common elements of fascism include strong nationalist sentiment, xenophobia, subordination of individual interests to those of the community or "society", militarism and glorification of the army, secret police forces that enforce secret laws, informer networks, suppression of civil liberties and independent media, and economic policies that tightly tie business and commerce to government. (Note that many of these features are common in communist states as well.)

^Airfields function in the same manner that a city with an airport would for air units.  To construct an Airfield, 
move a worker to any neutral or owned land tile and select the Build Airfield unit action.  Construction of the 
Airfield consumes the worker.  Airfields can be a re-base mission destination.  All air missions can be launched 
from an airfield, and there is no limit to the number of aircraft that can be re-based at an Airfield.  Airfields 
can only be used by the player who created it.  If it falls into the territory of another civilization, however, 
the airfield becomes solely useable by the player whose territory it lies in (unless they have yet to research 
Flight, in which case the airfield is destroyed).  Airfields can only be built in tiles that are empty or have a 
road and/or railroad.  The "Build Airfield" unit-action becomes available after the Flight advance is 
researched.

^Radar Towers provide a combat bonus to units within their affected area.  To construct a Radar Tower, move a 
worker to any land tile within your territory and select the "Build Radar Tower" unit action. Construction of 
the Radar Tower consumes the worker.  The range of the effected area is 2 tiles. Friendly units within the Radar 
Towers range get a +25% attack and defense bonus.  This bonus can only be applied once, even if multiple towers 
overlap.  Radar Towers can only be used by the player who created them.  Should a Radar Tower fall into the

^The founding of Rome on the fertile Tibur River is obscured by myth and legend, but it is generally accepted that 
Rome was first settled in 753 BC and that the Republic was founded in 509 BC, following the overthrow of Lucius 
Tarquinius Superbus, the last of Rome's seven kings. Rome was built on a site highly prized by the Etruscans, who 
dominated the Italian peninsula in the 6th century BC. The Etruscan king Porsenna defeated the Romans and expelled 
Tarquinius Superbus. Yet before Porsenna could establish himself as monarch over the unruly Romans, he was forced 
to withdraw. Rather than restoring their inept king, the citizens replaced the monarchy with two elected consuls, 
generals whose primary task it was to lead Rome's armies, and a Senate to serve as an advisory body. Where the 
Etruscans had failed, the people of Rome succeeded in the task of unifying the various Italian peoples into a 
political whole.
^    Toward the end of the 5th century BC, the Romans, propelled by the pressures of unchecked population growth, 
began to expand at the expense of nearby city-states. Rome's first two wars were fought with Fidenae, an independent 
city near Rome, and against Veii, an important Etruscan city. In the process, the expanding Roman Republic found the 
Greek phalanx formation too unwieldy for fragmented fighting in the hills and valleys of central Italy; accordingly, 
Rome evolved a new tactical system based on flexible ranks of cohorts, organized into self-contained {Legions}, the 
means by which Imperial Rome conquered and ruled the ancient world.
^    When Rome became increasingly powerful, the remaining city-states took up arms; the ensuing Latin War (340-338 BC) 
was quickly decided in Rome's favor. By 264 BC all Italy south of the Alps was united under the leadership of Rome, 
its members either incorporated in or allied with the Republic. Rome's growing influence led it into conflict with 
Carthage, an established commercial power in northern Africa. The defeat and destruction of Carthage in the three 
Punic Wars (264-146 BC) sustained Rome's acquisitive momentum, and the Republic set its sights on dominating the 
entire Mediterranean area. In short order, the
#DESC_RACE_ROMANS

^
^Romans overran Syria, Macedonia, Greece and Egypt, all of which had 
until then been part of the decaying Hellenistic empire created by Alexander the Great.
^    But such expansion was not without costs; tensions grew and civil war erupted. The ensuing period of unrest and 
revolution marked the transition of Rome from a republic to an empire. The later stages of these civil wars encompassed 
the careers of the brilliant Pompey, the orator Cicero, and the consul {Julius Caesar}, the conqueror of Gaul (58-50 BC), 
who eventually was given power over Rome as its dictator. After his assassination in 44 BC, it was not long before civil 
war again erupted; but following his victory at Actium (31 BC), Octavian, Julius' nephew, was crowned Rome's first 
emperor, Augustus 27 BC-14 AD). Although there were exceptions such as Caligula (37-41) and Nero (54-68), Rome was 
blessed with a series of able and brilliant leaders who expanded the frontiers until Rome's empire reached from Britain 
to Egypt and from Spain to Persia.
^    Imperial Rome was distinguished not only for its military - the foundation upon which the empire rested - but 
also for its accomplishments in engineering and statecraft. The Romans were gifted in the applied arts of law, 
record-keeping and city planning, yet they also acknowledged and adopted the contributions of earlier peoples - 
most notably, those of the Greeks, much of whose culture was thereby preserved. Roman law was a complex body of 
precedents and opinions, which were finally codified in the 6th century as the Justinian Code. The empire's road 
network was without match in the ancient world, designed for rapid movement of commerce, agriculture, mail delivery 
as well as the army. Roman city planners achieved unprecedented standards of hygiene with their plumbing, sewage 
disposal, dams and aqueducts. Roman art and architecture, though often imitative of Greek styles, was boldly planned 
and lavishly executed. Roman science and culture, in short, became the foundations of the European world.

^Few civilizations have left such an indelible mark on history as that of ancient Egypt. Though the first settlers 
of the Nile valley are thought to have arrived as early as 7000 BC, it wasn't until the legendary king Menes unified 
Upper and Lower Egypt that the region began to develop a cohesive sense of culture and identity. This First Dynasty 
(2925-2775 BC), with its capital at Memphis, was followed by 26 more over the next 2700 years. Writing was the major 
instrument in the centralization and self-preservation of Egypt. The two basic forms of writing, hieroglyphs and the 
cursive form known as hieratic (used on papyrus), were invented at much the same time in late pre-dynastic Egypt 
(about 3000 BC). Writing was used chiefly for administration and until about 2650 BC no continuous texts were recorded; 
the only literary texts written down before the early Middle Kingdom (1950 BC) seem to have been lists of religious 
practices and medical treatises. Another strength was the Egyptian religion, which was one of the most enduring of 
the ancient world, through which Egypt became a highly stratified, highly efficient society. Egypt’s economic strength 
allowed for the support of a priestly class, who were tasked with the spiritual well being of the people yet able to 
devote their time to the study of religion, astronomy, philosophy and mathematics. The priesthood also served the 
functions of a state bureaucracy, carrying out the edicts of the Pharaoh and managing his financial and diplomatic 
affairs. The great organizational and economic power of Egypt allowed the rulers to accomplish unmatched works of 
construction. The Great Pyramids of Giza, completed in the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2465 BC), still stand as one of mankind’s 
most impressive feats of engineering and logistics.
^    Previous to 1700 BC, no outsiders had ever held dominion over Egypt. That changed when the Hyksos, a Semitic 
people, overran Lower Egypt. Thereafter, Egypt’s borders were defended by capable Libyan warriors and the elite often 
rode into battle in {War Chariots}, which were able to use speed to outflank opponents and break up organized formations 
of troops. Egypt’s greatest military strength,
#DESC_RACE_EGYPTIANS

^
however, lay in the employment of mercenaries from Macedonia, Greece, 
Nubia and many other neighboring peoples - Egyptian gold was always their most valuable military asset. However, 
this was not enough to guarantee the isolation of the richest land in the Mediterranean world. Egypt fell to the 
Assyrians, and then to the Persians yet even during the plunder of Xerxes’ governors, Egyptian culture and religion 
survived. Alexander the Great liberated the Egyptians from Persian rule in 332 BC and established the city of 
Alexandria, which was to become the new capital of Hellenic Egypt under the rule of the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty 
(332-30 BC), the last Egyptian kingdom. The kingdom was one of several that emerged in the aftermath of Alexander's 
death and the struggles of his successors. It was the wealthiest, however, and for much of the next 300 years, 
the most powerful politically and militarily.
^    The able Ptolemies ruled in an unbroken line until the death of 
{Cleopatra} VII in 30 BC. Cleopatra’s infamous liaisons with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony proved the eventual 
downfall of independent Egypt. Her ambition rivaled theirs, and sadly it served her no better. Her suicide marked 
the end of Pharaohic rule and the beginning of Egypt's centuries as a Roman and Byzantine province. Although swept 
by the Islamic tide in 642 AD, Egypt was to remain under foreign occupation - Arabic, Ottoman, French and British - 
until after World War I, when she finally gained her independence from a British administration weary of overseas 
conflict. From 1922 through 1952, Egypt appeared to be one of the world’s most successful constitutional monarchies. 
But it was ripe for revolution; the military coup of July 1952 led by Gamal Nasser, ironically, finally made Egypt 
an island of stability in a turbulent Middle East.

^The period following the catastrophic collapse of the Mycenaean civilization in Greece (about 1200 BC) was marked 
by a series of migrations by barbarian peoples from the north, leading to a number of city-states - prominent among 
these, Sparta and Athens - and a phase of Greek colonization along the shores of the Mediterranean.
For two centuries, Greek history was a provincial tale of neighbors squabbling over scarce resources. 
But it was also the dawn of philosophy and science. There seems to be no good reason why the Hellenes, 
clustered in isolated city-states in a relatively poor and backward land, should have struck out into intellectual 
regions that were only dimly perceived, if at all, by the splendid civilizations of the Yangtze, the Tigris and 
Euphrates, and the Nile valleys; but they did.
^    The Persian Wars (492-449 BC) were sparked by a revolt of Greek colonies in Asia Minor and brought the Greeks 
onto the stage of world history. Athens and Eretria sent a small fleet in support of the revolt, which the Persian 
emperors took as a pretext for launching two invasions of the Greek mainland. In 490 BC a Persian army under 
Darius I (522-486 BC) landed unopposed on the plain of Marathon; following an appeal to the Spartans, the Athenian-led 
Greeks won a decisive victory. A second invasion ten years later, blunted by the valiant stand by the Spartans and 
Thespians at Thermopylae (481 BC), ended with the crushing defeat of the Persian fleet at Salamis. Sporadic fighting 
between Greek alliances and Persia continued for another 30 years, before the Peace of Callas (449 BC) finally ended 
the hostilities. The surprising Greek triumph ensured the survival of Greek culture and political structures. 
^    Growing tensions among the victors led to the Peloponnesian Wars (431-404 BC), fought between Athens and Sparta. 
The Athenian league was, in fact, an empire that included most of the island and coastal states around the shores of 
the Aegean Sea, while Sparta was leader of an alliance of independent cities that included most of the major land 
powers of the peninsula. The end finally came in 404 BC when, starved by an impenetrable blockade, Athens capitulated. 
Athens' devastation and decline was perhaps the worst casualty in a war that crippled Greek unity.

^    By this time, a new power was growing in the north of Greece. In 353 BC, Philip I was in undisputed control of a 
much-enlarged Macedonia. Phalanx tactics were known from ancient Sumer and Egypt, but Philip perfected the tactical 
use of spear-wielding {Hoplites} in dense, massive blocks of eight, or even 16-20 ranks, sacrificing flexibility 
and mobility in order to achieve maximum protection and power. Unless {Alexander} (336-323 BC) was himself 
responsible for his father's assassination in 336 BC, he cannot have foreseen the moment of his succession - 
but he was certainly prepared. Educated by Aristotle and left in charge of Macedonia during Philip's attack on 
Byzantium, Alexander defeated the Maedi; two years later he commanded the left wing at the battle of Chaeronea, 
in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states. By the time of his death at the age of 33, Alexander had moved 
the great centers of civilization westward initiating a new age, spread Hellenism in a vast colonizing wave 
throughout the Middle East and created, at least economically and culturally if not politically, a single civilization 
stretching from Gibraltar to the Punjab, open to trade and intellectual intercourse.
^    However, the Greek empire could hardly survive Alexander's death. During a 40-year (323-280 BC) interregnum, 
the provinces became independent kingdoms, with various of Alexander's generals rising to rule through bloodshed 
and assassination, yet unable to ally against the coming of a new military power. By 350 BC, Rome was encroaching 
on the westernmost Greek settlements, beginning a 200-year conquest of the Hellenic world that Alexander had created. 
With the defeat of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony, Octavian's forces occupied Egypt and the last kingdom of Alexander's 
successors fell to Rome. For two millennia, Greece was part of the Roman, then Byzantine and finally the Ottoman 
empires. Following an uprising supported by Britain, Russia and France, Greece's existence as an independent nation 
gained formal recognition in 1832.

^Because of the historical significance and legendary status achieved by the city of Babylon, the term "Babylonian" 
is often used to refer to all of the ancient cultures and tribes of Mesopotamia. The oldest known urban and literate 
culture in the world was developed by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia beginning in the late 4th millennium BC. 
For centuries, Babylon was an insignificant suburb of the Sumerian capital of Ur until {Hammurabi} (1792-1750 BC) 
came to power. Hammurabi unified the bickering Sumerians and Akkadians and created the famous Code of Hammurabi, 
the most comprehensive code of laws of antiquity with 283 entries covering topics from criminal punishments to 
family laws. Under Hammurabi, Babylon became the commercial and political center of southern Mesopotamia, but 
its prestige and wealth made it a target for foreign conquerors. The city and empire would be ruled, in succession, 
by the Hittites, Kassites, Assyrians, Arameans and Chaldeans.
^    Under the Chaldean leader Nebuchadnezzar II (605-561 BC), Babylon entered its second golden age, spanning 
the 7th and 6th centuries BC. Aside from the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah, Nebuchadnezzar II is best known 
for his efforts to rebuild Babylon and reorganize its military forces, returning it to glory as one of the great 
cities in the ancient world. The fabled Hanging Gardens were constructed at Nebuchadnezzar's decree, reportedly 
to help his Median wife overcome her longing for the "mountainous scenery" of her homeland. He also rebuilt the 
great Temple of Marduk and its ziggurat, collectively known as the Tower of Babel. Following Nebuchadnezzar's 
death, his successor Nabonidus failed to maintain the skilled {Bowmen} formations and the massive fortifications 
of the great city. When the Persians under Cyrus attacked in  539 BC, the capital fell almost without resistance. 
Babylon remained in Persian hands until Alexander the Great 
overthrew the Persian Empire. Alexander planned to make Babylon the center of his expanded Hellenic empire; however, 
he died in Nebuchadnezzar's palace before those plans could be completed. Alexander's empire would not 
#DESC_RACE_BABYLON
^
^
survive his 
death; after a power struggle among Alexander's generals, Babylon passed to the Seleucid dynasty in 312 BC. 
The city's importance was much reduced by the building of a new capital, Seleucia, on the Tigris, to which most of 
Babylon's population was forcibly transferred in 275 BC. In the 2nd century BC Mesopotamia became part of the 
Parthian empire, and Babylon itself a buffer region between the Parthians and the Roman Empire. By the time of 
Christ, the city was an extensive field of ruins and largely deserted. In the 7th century AD, Mesopotamia was 
conquered by Muslim Arabs. Babylon passed into legend, and from that time forward the history of the Babylonian 
realm is that of Iraq and Iran. The city itself would not be re-discovered until the initial surveys by the 
British archaeologist C.J. Rich in 1811 and 1817. Major excavation began in 1899, under the auspices of the 
German Oriental Society, and have continued unabated since, revealing more of the wonders of the lost city of Babylon.

^Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars brought the Germanic tribes into the spotlight of history. Although Roman efforts to 
establish hegemony across the Rhine continued for decades, the frontier eventually stabilized along the Rhine and 
Danube rivers. At that time, Germanic culture extended from Scandinavia as far south as the Carpathians. Although 
it was heavily fortified, the frontier was never a barrier to trade or culture. Germanic fear of the Huns meant 
that the Roman Empire could, in moments of crisis, mobilize at least the Goths, Burgundians, and Franks for mutual 
defense. Soon after Attila's death in 453, however, the Hun empire collapsed, and Rome lost this hold over the 
Germans.
^    The Merovingian kings and their Carolingian successors eventually brought much of what would later constitute 
Germany under Frankish control, but the ceaseless blows from Danes, Saracens and Magyars in the later 9th and 10th 
centuries weakened the kingdom's cohesion. Because the Carolingians themselves were unable to provide effective defense 
for the empire, there arose in nearly all the German lands powerful lines of margraves, counts and hereditary rulers, 
their intrigues and wars against each other interrupted only briefly by the rise of strong electors such as Frederick 
Barbarossa (1155-1190). The subsequent history of Germany is, despite the role of the central rule of the Holy Roman 
Empire, one of the rise and fall of feuding principalities. 
^    It would be a thousand years before Germany was again unified under a single ruler. Troubled by the mass 
insurrections and diplomatic defeats that had followed the Napoleonic Wars, William I of Prussia (1861-1888) 
considered abdicating in favor of his son, who was believed to have political views close to those of the liberal 
opposition. He was persuaded, however, to consider forming a new government led by {Otto von Bismarck}, the 
Prussian ambassador to Paris.
^    In September 1862, Europe was startled by the news that a statesman with a reputation 
for conservatism, nationalism and [realpolitik] had become the prime minister of Prussia. The new German Empire was
proclaimed in January 1871, in the aftermath of three short

and decisive wars against Denmark, Austria and France by 
coalitions of German states. Bismarck had unified Germany.
^    The same nationalism that brought unity would bring disaster. Already staggering under a vengeful peace 
imposed by the Western Allies following World War I, the worldwide economic collapse that began in 1929 proved 
the catalyst for political extremism. Although bitterly opposed to each other, the Nazis and Communists during 
the next decade succeeded in mobilizing the political and economic resentments generated by defeat and depression.  
When Hitler finally became chancellor in January 1933, it was not on the crest of a wave of popular support but as 
the result of ruthless political intrigue.
^    World War II is appropriately called "Hitler's War." Spearheaded by {Panzer} 
formations using revolutionary new tactics, Hitler came close to realizing his aim of establishing German hegemony in 
Europe. But the turning point of the war came with his decision to send his Panzers into Soviet Russia. Though at the 
end of 1942 an ultimate German victory still seemed possible, by spring 1945 the Third Reich was prostrate. As a 
legacy of surrender and the ensuing Cold War, a truncated Germany was divided into two zones of military occupation. 
While under Soviet rule East Germany suffered and stagnated, West Germany's recovery from total economic and political 
prostration at the end of World War II was of such dramatic proportions as to become a modern legend.
^    The swift and 
unexpected downfall of the Soviet order in Europe led to a unification treaty, ratified by the West German Bundestag 
and the East German People's Chamber in September 1990. After 45 years of division, Germany was once again a united 
nation.

^Indo-European, Ural-Altaic, and other races have occupied what is now the territory of Russia since 2000 BC, 
but little is known about their institutions and activities. Modern Russia dates from about 770, when Viking 
explorers began an intensive penetration of the Volga region. From bases in estuaries along the eastern Baltic, 
Scandinavian bands, probably in search of new trade routes to the east, began to penetrate territory populated 
by Finnish and Slavic tribes, where they found unlimited natural resources.
^    Within a few decades the Rus, as the Viking settlers were known, together with other Scandinavians operating 
farther west, extended their raiding activities down the main river routes toward Baghdad and Constantinople, 
reaching the Black Sea in 860. In the period from 930 to 1000, the region came under complete control by the Rus 
from their capital at Novgorod.
^    The lifeblood of this sprawling Kievan empire was the commerce organized by these Viking princes. Novgorod's 
burghers even forged an accommodation with the invading Mongols during the 13th century, but its absorption by the 
growing Slavic principality of Muscovy in 1478 ended its political independence.
^    Ivan III (1462-1505) consolidated the gains his father, Vasily II, had won in the saddle. This "gathering of 
the Russian lands" became a conscious and irresistible five-century drive by Moscow to annex all Slavic lands, both 
the Russian territories and the Belorussian and Ukrainian regions. The ascension of Peter I (the Great; 1694-1725) 
ushered in and established the social, political and intellectual trends that were to dominate Russia for the next 
two centuries. The location of his capital, St. Petersburg, on the shores of the Gulf of Finland symbolized this 
shift toward a European involvement. 
^    {Catherine the Great} (1762-1796) would prove to be Peter's true intellectual and political heir. Catherine's 
reign was notable for imperial expansion. Most important were the securing of the northern shore of the Black Sea, 
the annexation of the Crimea, and the expansion into the steppes beyond the Urals. This permitted the protection of

^agricultural settlements in the south and the establishment of trade routes through the Black Sea. In the 
process, the military democracies of the {Cossack} hosts along the Dnieper, Don and Volga rivers lost their autonomy 
and special privileges; the wealthier officers became Russian nobles, receiving the right to own and settle serfs on 
their own lands, while the fierce horsemen sank to the level of peasants with special military obligations.
^    Despite the heritage of Peter and Catherine, by the time of Nicholas II (1894-1917) Russia was in disarray, 
fighting an onerous war and plagued by internal misery and oppression. The Kerensky provisional government, a 
moderate attempt to resolve the problems, collapsed in the face of the Bolshevik revolution. Given the Bolshevik 
desire to dominate the whole of Russia and the rest of the former tsarist empire, civil war was inevitable. Stalin 
would complete the consolidation of Communist power begun by Lenin. And he would lead Soviet Russia through the 
greatest threat to its existence, and help it emerge as one of the world's superpowers following the Second World War. 
^    But in the ensuing Cold War, Russia's economy tottered towards collapse. The people turned to Boris Yeltsin, 
a liberal Party functionary. Elections to the Congress of People's Deputies in March 1989 saw him score a stunning 
victory. He used his newfound legitimacy to promote Russian sovereignty, to advocate and adopt radical economic reform, 
to demand Gorbachev's resignation, and to negotiate treaties with the Baltic republics, in which he acknowledged their 
right to secede from the union. An ill-conceived, ill-planned, and poorly executed coup attempt to unseat Yeltsin 
occurred August 1991, bringing an end to the Communist Party and accelerating the movement to disband the Soviet 
Union. Yeltsin dissolved the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1991, banned the Communist Party in 
Russia and seized all of its property.

^Despite political and social upheavals that frequently ravaged the country, China is unique for its longevity 
and resilience as a politico-cultural entity. Most of China's cultural progress has been accomplished with relatively 
little outside influence; even when the country was ruled by such "barbarian" peoples as the Chin or Mongols, these 
were soon absorbed into the fabric of Chinese culture. The casting of bronze and the development of an alphabet date 
from the period of the Shang dynasty - China's first, believed to have dominated north China from the mid-16th to 
mid-11th century BC. The overthrow of the Shang dynasty by the Chou (1111-255 BC) spanned three generations; although 
the vibrant Chou culture produced some of history's greatest philosophers and artists, among them Confucius and Lao-zi, 
it was eventually supplanted by a "barbarian" invasion that established the brief Ch'in Empire (221-206 BC). 
The subsequent Han dynasty was founded by Liu Pang, who assumed the title of emperor in 202 BC. The four centuries of 
the Han was one of considerable changes in imperial, political, cultural and social development, as well as massive 
engineering projects (including the Great Wall), and established a Chinese identity that would survive until the 
advent of Communism.
^    By the end of the 2nd century AD the Han Empire had virtually ceased to exist, followed by a lengthy period of
rival kingdoms that did not end until 618 AD, when the T'ang dynasty came to power. The T'ang were followed by the
Sung dynasties (960-1279 AD), which collapsed in the face of the Mongol invasions. By securing the allegiance of
the Hsi Hsia in Tibet (1209), Genghis Khan disposed of a potential enemy and prepared the ground for an invasion
of China. For several years Mongol armies pillaged the country; finally, in 1214 Genghis overwhelmed the capital
of the northern Chin (modern Beijing). During the next decades there was an uneasy truce between the Mongols in the
north and the Sung state in the south. The Mongols resumed their advance in 1250 under Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis.

^attacked on several fronts. When organized resistance ceased soon afterward, foreign invaders controlled the whole of
China for the only time in history.
^    The Mongols occupied China for a century, but ineptitude on the throne, factionalism at court, and rivalries among
generals weakened their rule. Out of this turmoil emerged a new native dynasty, the Ming (1368-1644), known for
patronage of the arts. The Ming were followed by the Manchus (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty of China, marked
by continuous warfare, Western imperialism, rampant corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude. In the wake of the
disastrous Boxer Rebellion, the imperial court could no longer maintain support among the peasantry and army;
revolution (1911-1912) followed. The first half of the 20th century saw the disintegration of the old order in China
and the foundations of a new society, begun by the short-lived democratic Republic (1912-1920), which quickly
degenerated into the dictatorship of Yuan Shih-k'ai. A new revolution, led by the Nationalist Party (KMT) and the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP), erupted. Although united against the Japanese invasion, by the end of World War II
civil war raged in China. Nationalists and Communists raced to take over Japanese-held territories, built up their
forces, and fought limited engagements while still conducting negotiations; during 1947-1948, after initial Nationalist
victories, the strategic balance shifted in favor of the Communists. Four years after Japan's surrender, a profound
and popularly based revolution had swept China, and, in October 1949 {Mao Tse-tung} proclaimed the People's Republic
of China. In 1966, the Communists launched the disastrous "Cultural Revolution," a ten-year assault on "traditional
values" and "bourgeois thinking" which ultimately left the country in disarray. After Mao's death in 1976, his rival
Deng Xiaopeng assumed power and began social and economic reforms that would see China return to world prominence.

^The United States is relatively young by Civilization standards, being barely more than 200 years old; it achieved 
its current size and influence only in the mid-20th century. America was the first of the European colonies to separate 
successfully from its motherland, and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests 
with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with 
its own territorial exploration and expansion and with economic growth. American politics became increasingly democratic 
during the 1820s and '30s. But a matter of freedom would bring the nation to its greatest crisis: the American Civil War. 
On February 4, 1861 - a month before {Abraham Lincoln} (1860-1865) could be inaugurated in Washington - six Southern 
states sent representatives to Montgomery to declare a new independent government. With Jefferson Davis at its head, the 
Confederate States of America came into being, set up its own bureaus and offices, occupied federal buildings, issued its 
own money, raised its own taxes, and flew its own flag.
^    With the Union preserved, the nation entered a period of unprecedented prosperity after the long conflict and 
reconstruction. In the ensuing two decades industrial production, the number of industrial workers, and the number 
of factories all more than doubled. European immigration, westward expansion, urban growth, technological advances 
and a host of American inventions - including the telephone, typewriter, linotype, phonograph, electric light, cash 
register, air brake, refrigerator car, and the automobile - contributed to the American explosion, while widespread 
use of corporate organization offered new opportunities for large-scale financing of business enterprise and attracted 
new capital.
^    Militarily speaking, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was so brief and relatively bloodless as to have been a 
mere passing episode in the history of modern warfare, but it catapulted the United States into the world arena. 
Before the 1890s, roughly speaking, most Americans had stubbornly adhered to the belief, as old as the

#DESC_RACE_AMERICAN
Revolution 
itself, that their country should remain aloof from European affairs and offer an example of democracy and peace to 
the rest of the world. But the United States had become a great power by virtue of its prodigious economic growth 
since the Civil War; now many thought it ought to begin to act like one.
^    In World War I, and again in World War II, 
American industrial might and military technology proved decisive. However, the debacle of Vietnam, set in the morass 
of the Cold War, shook America's belief in its "victory culture" and "manifest destiny," a malaise that would not pass 
for 20 years. Lasting but 40 days, the Gulf War was easily won by the U.S.-led coalition at only slight material and 
human cost, but its sophisticated weapons - spearheaded by the American {F-15} fighters - caused heavy damage to 
Iraq's military and economic infrastructure. With the declining power (and subsequent collapse in 1991) of the 
Soviet Union, the war also emphasized the role of the United States as the world's single superpower at the beginning 
of the 21st century, its culture and technology spreading around the globe.

^It is not known when humans first settled on the Japanese archipelago, but the Jomon people might be called 
proto-Japanese, and they were spread throughout the archipelago by 250 BC. The Yayoi culture that arose in Kyushu, 
while the Jomon culture was still evolving, spread gradually eastward, overwhelming the Jomon. Culturally, the 
Yayoi represents a notable advance and flourished for some five or six centuries, from the 3rd century BC to the 
3rd century AD. The unification of Japan under the Yamato court, with the tenno ("Emperor of Heaven") at its center, 
occurred around the mid-4th century. The 6th century reign of Kentai (507-531 AD) represents a decline of Yamato 
influence both at home and abroad; the period can be characterized by the growing accumulation of power by regional 
leaders and a weakening of royal influence.
^    After the Onin War, the power of independent local leaders increased markedly, and in many instances deputies 
of great shugo houses usurped the domains of their superiors; a new type of feudal lord, the daimyo, took their place. 
This Sengoku ("Warring States") period was marked by constant conflict among many such lords. The Yamato court was 
resuscitated by efforts made within the royal family itself, primarily the reforms of Prince Shotoku, who drafted 
the Seventeen-Article Constitution of 604 AD. The death of Shotoku in 622 prevented his Confucian ideals of government 
from bearing full fruit when the Soga family, regaining its former power, executed Shotoku's son Yamashiro and all 
his family in 643. Two years later, princes Nakano and Nakatomi engineered a coup d'état within the palace, killing 
the Soga family and wiping out all forces opposed to the imperial family. They then set about establishing a system 
of centralized government with the emperor as absolute monarch that would last 1000 years.
^    In the late Heian period, the more powerful of the {Samurai} gathered in or near the capital, where they served 
both the military needs of the emperor and also as bodyguards for the great noble houses. Emerging from provincial 
warrior bands, the aristocratic Samurai caste of the Kamakura period (1192-1333), with their military
#DESC_RACE_JAPANESE
^
^
^skills and deep 
pride in their stoicism, developed a disciplined culture distinct from the earlier, quiet refinement of the imperial 
court.
^    Under the growing influence of Zen Buddhism during the Muromachi period (1338-1573), the samurai culture produced 
many uniquely Japanese arts that continue today. Eventually, from among these warring Samurai clans arose the able 
{Tokugawa} Takechiyo, founder of the Edo shogunate (1603-1867 AD), which ended the incessant conflicts and brought 
reform and peace to the islands. Although Spanish and Portuguese traders and missionaries had been in Japan since 
the mid-1500s, it was the arrival of a squadron of U.S. warships commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry in Uraga Bay 
in July 1853 that finally opened the nation to Western influence - and brought pressure for political reforms and a 
national identity. The Meiji government that followed the overthrow of the shogunate set about the task of 
westernization and the creation of a modern state, and moved Japan onto the world stage.
^    Ironically, Japan's new, influential role - marked by the ensuing Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), 
Japan's involvement in the First World War and in the Allied intervention in Siberia following the Bolshevik 
Revolution of 1918 - led indirectly to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the horrors that followed. The summer of 
1945 brought disaster for the Japanese: the Americans took Okinawa in a bloody invasion, in August the Soviet 
Union declared war and swept over Manchuria, and atomic bombs largely destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, respectively. The Pacific War came to an end on August 14, with the formal surrender 
signed on September 2 in Tokyo Bay aboard the battleship USS Missouri. With postwar American aid, from 1952 to 1973 
Japan experienced accelerated economic growth and social change. By the 1990s, Japan was again a first-class power, 
the senior partner in the emerging Asian economic bloc.

^Modern France has its roots in ancient Gaul. In the 2nd century BC Rome intervened on the side of Massilia (Marseilles), 
a Greek colony founded in 600 BC, in its struggle against the barbarian tribes of the hinterland. The result was the 
formation, in 121 BC, of the Roman Provincia; between 58 to 50 BC Caesar seized the remainder. From 395 the internal 
problems of the Empire encouraged barbarian penetration of 
Transalpine Gaul. By 418, the Franks and Burgundians were established west of the Rhine, and the Visigoths had settled 
in Aquitaine. The period of the Merovingian and Carolingian Frankish dynasties (476-887) frames the Early Middle Ages. 
^    Following his ascension, the first Merovingian, Clovis (481-511), consolidated the position of the Franks in northern 
Gaul. Clovis came to believe that his victories were due to the Christian God. Clovis' subsequent conversion assured 
the Frankish rulers of the support not only of the Catholic Church but of the majority of their own subjects. By the 
rise of the house of Valois in 1328, France was the most powerful kingdom in Europe. Its ruler could muster larger 
armies than rivals; he could tap enormous fiscal resources; and the king's courts maintained royal supremacy. The 
history of France in the Late Middle Ages is dominated by efforts of its kings to maintain their suzerainty, efforts 
that, despite French advantages, were long frustrated. 
^    The Hundred Years War was an intermittent struggle between 
England and France in the 14th-15th centuries over a series of dynastic disputes, including the legitimate succession 
to the French crown. The war's turning point was reached in 1429, when an English army was forced to raise its siege 
of Orléans by a relief force organized by {Joan of Arc}. Her insistence that only consecration at Reims could make a 
true king, chosen by God, led to further victories. Charles III was anointed in Reims in July 1429. By 1453, England 
retained only Calais, which it finally relinquished in 1558.
^    With the ascension of the infant Louis XIII (1610-1643), the security of the country was again threatened as factions 
disputed the throne. Crown and country, however, were rescued by the most controversial 
#DESC_RACE_FRENCH
^
^
^figure of the Bourbon dynasty: 
Armand-Jean du Plessis, Cardinal de Richelieu. He proved an 
indefatigable servant of the French crown, intent on securing absolute obedience to the monarchy and on raising 
its international prestige through the military prowess of the King’s elite {Musketeers}. Under the last Bourbons, 
France became the industrial and commercial center of Europe.
^    These developments, although significant by themselves, 
gave rise to a still more momentous change: the French Enlightenment, a cultural transformation based on rationalism, 
empiricism, and an amorphous concept of freedom found in the influential writings of Rousseau (1712-78). Hence, what 
began in 1787 as a conflict between royal authority and aristocrats became a triangular struggle, with "the masses" 
opposing both absolutism and privilege. By any standard, the fall of the Bastille to the Parisian crowd was a monumental 
event, a seemingly miraculous triumph of the people. But the Revolution soon degenerated in a reign of terror and chaos. 
Unlike others before him, Napoleon terminated the bloodshed, but at the price of suppressing freedom altogether. 
In utter contrast to the Revolution, militarism became the defining quality of the Napoleonic regime. However, the 
revolutionary fervor of the French citizenry was undiminished by the Napoleonic experience, and led to further 
revolutions in 1830 and 1848, the latter leading to the Second Republic followed by the Second Empire (1852-1870). 
^    Following defeat in the Franco-Prussia War, the Third Republic was formed - surviving the First World War but 
collapsing in the face of the German invasion in 1940. The period of the short-lived Fourth Republic (1947-59) 
was succeeded by the Fifth, adopted in September 1958 by popular referendum.

^The Indian subcontinent is the home of one of the world's oldest and most influential civilizations. From about 
5000 BC, increasing numbers of settlements of subsistence agriculturalists began to appear throughout the Indus 
Valley; by 2600 BC some of these villages grew into urban centers, forming the basis for the early Harappan 
civilization, the peer of contemporary Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations. However, unlike these regions, 
centralized imperialism, which was attempted in the Mauryan Period (325-185 BC), collapsed. Nonetheless, the 
ascension of Chandra Gupta Maurya (321-297 BC) is significant because it inaugurated the first Indian empire; 
the Mauryan dynasty was to rule almost the entire subcontinent except the southern coasts.
^    Using {War Elephants} to good effect, he defeated Alexander's successor Seleucus, the ruler of the eastern 
Greek holdings in Iran and India. The result was a treaty by which Seleucus ceded the trans-Indus provinces to 
Chandra and the latter presented Seleucus with 500 elephants for his own army. A century later, the disintegration 
of the Mauryan empire gave rise to a number of feuding kingdoms, the Guptas and Pajputs in the north and Chola, 
Hoysalas and Pandyas in the south, unable to stand alone against the coming Islamic tide.
^    The first Arabic raids in the subcontinent were made along the western coast and in Sind during the 7th and 
8th centuries, and there had been Muslim trading communities in India for decades before. The permanent military 
movement of Muslims into northern India, however, dates from the late 12th century and was carried out by the 
Turkish dynasty that arose on the ruins of the Abbasid caliphate. Sultan Mahmud, who conducted more than 20 
campaigns in India from 1001 to 1027 AD and established a large but short-lived empire, laid the road to conquest. 
By 1186 AD, the Mahmud realm had been destroyed by the Ghurids, who proceeded to conquer the Rajput kingdoms and 
establish a Muslim sultanate in Delhi, from which a series of able Turkish overlords ruled the north until 1526 AD.
#DESC_RACE_INDIAN

^The Muslim states were themselves supplanted by the Mughul Empire (1526-1761 AD), founded by Zahir-ud-Din 
Muhammad Babur (1526-1530 AD). Babur was a Mongol, a fifth-generation descendant of Timur and a 14th-generation 
descendant of Genghis Khan. In a lightning series of campaigns commencing in 1511 AD, he overran the Punjab and 
Hindustan. Akbar the Great (1556-1605 AD), his grandson, continued the conquest of the subcontinent, overrunning 
Gujarat, Bengal and Rajasthan. At its zenith, the Mughal realm commanded resources unprecedented in Indian history 
and covered almost the entire subcontinent.
^    The 16th and 17th centuries also saw the establishment and expansion of European trading organizations in 
the subcontinent, principally for the procurement of rare resources. By 1740, the Portuguese, Dutch, English and 
French had all founded colonial settlements, but with the Seven Years' War the French holdings were surrendered 
to the British East India Company. The quarter-century following the bitter Indian revolt of 1857-59, which transferred 
the company's rule to the crown, ended with the birth of nationalist agitation.
^    The Indian National Congress held its first meeting in December 1885 in Bombay even as Indian troops were 
fighting in upper Burma under the British flag. {Mohandas Gandhi} (1869-1948), later known as Mahatma ("Great-Souled"), 
was recognized throughout India as the spiritual leader of a nationwide movement for independence. The Jallianwala 
Bagh (1919) massacre turned millions of moderate Indians from patient and loyal supporters of the British raj into 
fervent nationalists. The last years of British rule were racked by increasingly violent Hindu-Muslim conflict and 
intensified opposition to foreign rule. In July 1947, Britain's Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act, ordering 
the demarcation of the dominions of India and Pakistan by midnight of August 14, 1947, and dividing within a single 
month the assets of history's largest and richest colony.

^The term Persia has been used for centuries, chiefly in the West, to designate a region of southern Iran formerly 
known as Persis or Parsa; the name of the Indo-European nomadic people who migrated into the region about 1000 BC, 
eventually supplanting the Assyrians and Chaldeans. The first mention of the Parsa occurs in the annals of Shalmanesar 
III, an Assyrian king, in 844 BC. Cyrus II (559-529 BC), heir to a long line of ruling chiefs in Mesopotamia, was a 
tolerant and venerated monarch, called the father of his people by the ancient Persians. After a successful revolt 
against his Achaemenian overlords in 550 BC and inheriting the kingdom of the Medes, Cyrus consolidated his rule on 
the Iranian Plateau and extended it westward across Asia Minor.
^    In October 539 BC, Babylon, the greatest city of the ancient world, fell to his Persian forces. Following the 
death of Cyrus' heir, Darius I (522-486 BC), a leading general and one of the princes of the Achaemenid family, 
proclaimed himself king following suppression of a number of provincial rebellions and challenges from other pretenders 
to the throne. Darius was in the mold of Cyrus the Great - a powerful personality and a dynamic ruler. To consolidate 
his accession, Darius I founded his new capital of Parsa, known to the Greeks as Persepolis ("Persian City") and 
expanded the ranks of his personal bodyguard, the {Immortals}.
^    Although Darius consolidated and added to the conquests of his predecessors, it was as an administrator that 
he made his greatest contribution to Persian history. During his reign, political and legal reforms revitalized the 
provinces and ambitious projects were undertaken to promote imperial trade and commerce: coinage, weights and measures 
were standardized, and new land and sea routes explored and established.
^    Such activities, however, did not prevent Darius from following an active expansionist policy. Campaigns in the 
east confirmed gains made by Cyrus the Great and added large sections of the northern 
#DESC_RACE_PERSIAN
^
^
^Indian subcontinent to the list 
of Persian-controlled provinces. Expansion to the west began about 516 BC when Darius moved against the Greek colonies 
along the coast of Asia Minor.
^    {Xerxes} (486-465 BC), son and successor of Darius I, was determined to continue the Persian conquest of the west 
and is best known for his massive invasion of Greece from across the Hellespont in 480 BC, a campaign marked by the 
battles of Thermopylae, Salamis and Plataea. Although successful in the pacification of Egypt and suppression of a 
Babylon revolt, his defeat by the allied Greek city-states spelled the beginning of the decline of the Persian Empire. 
Soured by these reversals, Xerxes retired to his palaces at Susa and Persepolis. In his last years, he squandered the 
once-enormous treasury he had gathered through trade and taxation by launching vast construction programs, most never 
finished.
^    The death of Xerxes was the final turning point in Persian influence. Occasional flashes of vigor and ability by 
some of Xerxes' successors were too infrequent to prevent eventual collapse. The final act was played out during the 
reign Darius II (423-404 BC), who rose to the throne through palace intrigue. Darius was able to put down yet another 
rebellion in Egypt in 337-336 BC, but the beginning of the end came soon afterward with his defeat at the Battle of 
Granicus (334 BC) by Alexander the Great. Persepolis fell to the young Macedonian conqueror in April 330 BC, and Darius, 
the last Achaemenid, was murdered in the summer of the same year while fleeing the Greek forces. In the struggle for 
power after Alexander's death, Seleucus I brought under his control the Persian provinces of Alexander's empire. But 
this unity was short-lived, as the Indian holdings successfully revolted and the Seleucid kingdom broke into the 
competing nations of Parthia and Bactria. The last vestiges of Persian culture disappeared with the advent of Islam 
and the Arab conquest (640-829 AD) of Iran.

^
^The origin of the Aztec people is uncertain, but elements of their own tradition suggest that they were a tribe 
of hunter-gatherers on the northern Mexican plateau before their appearance in Meso-America in the 12th century. 
The Aztec were so called for Aztlán ("White Land"), an allusion to their origins in northern Mexico. It is possible 
that their migration southward was part of a general movement of peoples that followed, or perhaps helped trigger, 
the collapse of the Toltec civilization. The Aztecs settled on islands in Lake Texcoco and in 1325 founded Tenochtitlán, 
which remained their chief city. The basis of the Aztec's success in creating a great state and ultimately an empire was 
their remarkable system of agriculture, which featured intensive cultivation of all available land, as well as elaborate 
systems of irrigation and reclamation of swampland. The high productivity gained by these methods made for a rich and 
populous state. The empire the Aztecs established was equaled in the New World only by that of the Incas of Peru, and 
the brilliance of their civilization is comparable to that of other great ancient cultures of the New and the Old World.
^    Under a succession of ambitious kings they established a dominion that eventually stretched over most of 
present-day Mexico. By commerce and conquest, Tenochtitlán came to rule an empire of 400 to 500 small states, 
comprising by 1519 some five- to six-million people spread over 80,000 square miles. Valor in war, notably in 
the feared {Jaguar Warrior} formations, was the surest path to advancement in Aztec society, which was caste- 
and class-divided but nonetheless vertically fluid. The priestly and bureaucratic classes were involved in the 
administration of the empire, while at the bottom of society were classes of serfs, indentured servants, and 
outright slaves. The incredible story of a wandering tribe that was able to build an empire in one century 
(from the beginning of the 14th century to the beginning of the 15th) can be largely explained by three main factors: 
the Aztec religion, the thriving trade routes centered on Tenochtilán, and Aztec military organization. 
In 1502 the ninth

emperor {Montezuma} II (1502-1520) succeeded his uncle Ahuitzotl as the leader of an empire 
that had reached its greatest extent, stretching from what is now northern Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua. 
The Aztec empire was still expanding, and its society still evolving, when its progress was halted in 1519 by 
the appearance of Spanish adventurers. Montezuma was taken prisoner by Hernándo Cortés and died in custody. 
Montezuma's successors, Cuitláhuac and Cuauhtémoc, were unable to stave off the conquistadors and, with the 
Spanish sack of Tenochtitlán in 1521, the Aztec empire came to an end.

^The Zulu are a tribe of Nguni-speaking people centered in what is now the Natal province of South Africa. 
They are a branch of the southern Bantu and have close ethnic, linguistic and cultural ties with the Swazi 
and Xhosa. Before they overwhelmed the neighboring tribes under their leader {Shaka} in the early 19th century 
to form an empire, the Zulu were only one of the many patrilineal Nguni clans in the Mtetwa empire. Traditionally 
grain farmers, the Zulu also kept large herds of cattle on the lightly wooded grasslands, replenishing their herds 
by raiding neighboring tribes. Boys in Shaka's militaristic society were initiated at adolescence in groups called 
age sets. Each age set constituted a unit of the Zulu army and was stationed away from home at royal barracks under 
direct control of the King. Formed into regiments ({Impi}), these men could marry and leave service only when the 
king gave permission to the age set as a whole. 
^    On the death of the last Mtetwa emperor in 1817, Shaka (1816-28) established his clan's dominance over their 
neighbors and, using a well-disciplined and efficient fighting force, conquered most of the Natal region. During 
the reign of Shaka's successor, Dingane, Boer settlers, who formed an alliance with Dingane's brother and deposed 
him in 1840, penetrated the Zulu empire. The empires survived, but under King Mpande (1840-72) portions of Zulu 
territory were occupied by the Boers and by the British, who moved into Natal in 1838 and annexed it in 1843. 
War broke out in 1878 when Mpande's successor, Cetshwayo, refused to disband his Impi and to place himself under 
British control. Despite stiff resistance, the British defeated the poorly armed Zulu in July 1879, occupied the 
remainder of their country, and divided Zululand into 13 small kingdoms. Zululand was made a British crown colony 
in 1887 under the Native Law of Natal, and bloody Zulu rebellions were put down in 1888 and 1906. By British edict 
in 1894, two-thirds of the Zulu's remaining land was confiscated, and they were confined to native reserves. 
The incorporation of Zululand into Natal in 1897 ended its separate existence. Under the apartheid system, a Bantu 
Homeland (later called a "black state") named KwaZulu was established for the Zulu in the 1970s and was composed

areas of historical Zululand. With the abolition of the apartheid system, KwaZulu in 1994 was

^Loosely speaking, Iroquois is the term for any member of the Five (later, Six) Nations composed of several 
Native American tribes speaking a language of the Iroquoian family: the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, 
and Tuscarora (after 1722). At its greatest extent, the Five Nations occupied a vast territory around Lakes Ontario, 
Huron and Erie, in present-day New York state and Pennsylvania and southern Ontario and Quebec. Tradition credits 
the formation of the Iroquois Confederacy, forged between 1570 and 1600, to Dekanawidah, born a Huron, who is said 
to have persuaded {Hiawatha}, an influential Onondaga who had become the Mohawks' war chief, to abandon cannibalism 
and advance "peace, civil authority, righteousness, and the great law" as sanctions for confederation. Cemented mainly 
by their desire to stand together against invasion, the five tribes united in a common council composed of clan and 
village chiefs; each tribe had one vote, and unanimity was the rule. In this form, the Iroquois used a combination 
of military prowess and skilled diplomacy to conquer an empire. Until their internal unity finally failed them during 
the American Revolution, the Iroquois dealt with even the European powers as equals.
^    For nearly two centuries before the American Revolution, the Iroquois stood athwart the path from the Eastern 
coast to the Great Lakes, blocking the route to permanent settlement by the French and containing the Dutch and the 
English. Throughout the 18th century the Six Nations remained consistent and bitter enemies of the French, who were 
allied with their traditional foes, the Algonquins and Hurons. The Iroquois' success in maintaining their autonomy 
from both the French and English was a remarkable achievement for an aboriginal people. But during the American War 
of Independence, a schism developed within the Iroquois Confederation. The Oneida and Tuscarora espoused the American 
cause, while the rest of the league, led by Chief Joseph Brant's Mohawks, fought for the British, decimating isolated 
American settlements.
#DESC_RACE_IROQUOIS

^Eventually, the villages, fields, orchards and granaries, as well as the morale of the Iroquois, were destroyed 
in 1779 when Major-General John Sullivan led a retaliatory expedition of 4000 American regulars, and crushed their 
assembled warriors near present-day Elmira. Having finally acknowledged defeat in the Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix 
(1784), the Iroquois Confederacy effectively came to an end by ceding western Pennsylvania, New York and Kentucky to 
the United States. At the end of the Revolutionary War, there were less than 8000 Iroquois left. Even the 1940 U.S. 
census listed only 17,000 Iroquois in both the United States and Canada, but current figures approach 70,000 in about 
twenty settlements on eight reservations in New York, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Ontario and Quebec.

^In Roman times Britain lay on the periphery of the civilized world, and it emerged into the light of history 
only after the Saxon settlements in the 5th century AD. Tribal migrations into Britain began about the middle 
of the 5th century. The first arrivals were invited by a British chieftain to defend his kingdom against the Picts 
and Scots. The first mercenaries were from three tribes - the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes - which located on the 
coastlands of northwestern Germany. Eventually, these peoples would themselves topple the native kingdoms. But 
unity was fleeting; the subsequent Norman Conquest (1066) resulted in the subordination of England to a Frankish 
aristocracy, and the introduction of feudalism to the Isles.
^    The English Normans would eventually give rise to a 
purely British line of kings, the Plantagenets. Three centuries later, the Wars of the Roses was the final struggle 
between the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of the Plantagenets for control of the throne. When Henry Tudor, earl 
of Richmond, seized the crown in 1485, leaving the Yorkist Richard III dead upon the field of battle, few Englishmen 
would have predicted that 118 years of Tudor rule had begun. {Elizabeth} I (1558-1603) proved to be the most able Tudor 
monarch. No observer in 1558, any more than in 1485, would have predicted 
that despite the social discord, political floundering, and international humiliation of the past decades, the kingdom 
again stood on the threshold of an extraordinary age. Her reign ushered in two centuries of British exploration, 
colonization, artistic and intellectual advances. When Elizabeth, the "Virgin Queen," died childless, Parliament 
offered the crown to the closest blood kin, James VI of Scotland (1603-1625) and the United Kingdom was born, 
defended by the "wooden wall" of the Royal Navy’s {Men-o-War}. 
^    Every major war Britain engaged in during this period increased its colonial power. The Seven Years' War 
was particularly notable in this respect, and so were the Napoleonic Wars. By 1820 the total population  
of the British Empire was 200 million, 26% of the world's total population. However acquired, all these
acquisitions added to the crown’s and the country's power and reputation. For the privileged and the rich, 
the Victorian era was pre-eminently one of confidence

^and arrogance, under the able guidance of Britain’s two 
Prime Ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli. But the "long summer of peace" came to an end in the bloodbath of Flanders. 
Although Britain suffered far less physical damage than France and underwent no political revolution, World War 
I may have affected it more fundamentally than any other European power. The war was a catalyst for social and 
economic change. The mainstays of the Industrial Revolution, such as coal mining, textile production, and 
shipbuilding, upon which British prosperity had been built, were now impoverished or redundant. British 
foreign policy for much of the postwar period aimed at rehabilitating Germany, while domestic policy focused 
on institutionalizing socialism to counter public concerns. In general, these movements were opposed by France 
and resulted in a rupture between Britain and its wartime ally, forcing France into a position of isolation that 
would have prodigious consequences for Europe with the rise of Hitler in the 1930s. Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) 
set out to end socialism in Britain. Her most dramatic acts consisted of a continuing series of statutes to 
denationalize nearly every industry that Labour had brought into public ownership during the previous 40 years. 
Promising that "we shall govern as New Labour," the Blair government installed in general elections in 1997 accepted 
some of Thatcher's foreign policies but also carried out the economic reforms it promised in its manifesto. 
In retrospect, the 1990s were a period of transition, controversy and continuity in the United Kingdom, and for the 
royal family... Europe’s oldest surviving monarchy.

^
^The history of the Mongol tribe began with the birth of {Temujin}, born in c.1167 AD in the wild steppe-land of Mongolia, 
which is bordered by Modern Day China and Russia.  When Temujin was nine years old, tribal rivals poisoned and murdered 
his father Yesugei, creating a power vacuum in the tribe that resulted in the exile of young Temujin and his family as 
fugitives.  In time Temujin would return to claim his inheritance, forge political alliances, and vanquish old rivals. 
In 1204 AD he summoned a kuriltai war council and proceeded to unite all local nomad tribes by force.  It was at 
this time he received the title 'Genghis Khan', meaning 'Great Ruler'.
^    China, at the time, was divided by three sects:  the Ch'in, who were the most powerful, reigned in the north at 
Peking; the Sung occupied the South; and the Hsi-Hsia, the weakest of the 3, inhabited the western flank of the Great Wall.  
^    The Mongol conquest against China began in 1211 AD when the consolidated tribes of the Great Khan struck at the 
Hsi-Hsia, with tremendous success.  Not impressed with the defeat of his weaker neighbor, the new Emperor of Ch'in insisted 
on a public display of servitude from Temujin. Temujin reacted by ordering a general advance against the Ch'in Empire.  
The resulting war lasted for approximately 23 years, and ended in the complete destruction of the Ch'in. During this 
campaign Temujin ensured that the epic war upon the Ch'in did not occupy all of his resources and time; there were older 
enemies to address.
^    Amid the war against the Ch'in the Mongols also rallied against the Kara-Khitay, one of the original Kuchlug tribes 
that had fled from defeat during Temujin's war of unification.  Victory over the Kara-Khitay provided the Mongols a common 
frontier with the Shah of Khwarizm, who ruled a large Muslim state that stretched from modern day Iran to the southern 
Soviet Union as far as the Caspian and Aral seas.  In 1219 AD the Mongol horde gathered for the first of several large 
operations against Muslim and Persian enemies.  After defeating the Shah, the Mongols had access to Russia.  Not content 
with remaining a peaceful neighbor, Temujin permitted his generals 
#DESC_RACE_Mongols
^
^
^to lead an extraordinary campaign into southern Russia, which would be staged largely in the winter months.  Three years, 
and numerous victories later, they returned to rendezvous with the main Mongol force and to contribute in the war against 
the Ch'in and their Muslim enemies.
^    Mongol children were taught to ride on horseback from the age of three, and were given bow and arrows to use for hunting 
at the age of five.  Horseback became a natural way for the Mongols to conduct war.  When speed was essential, a Mongol rider 
could even sleep while in the saddle; and by using a system that consisted of approximately four remounts, Temujin's army was 
capable of traversing 130 miles in two days, with no breaks for food.
^    Another defining characteristic of a Mongolian army was the speed and voracity with which it was able to accept and 
prepare for battle.  The Mongol's harsh, nomadic lifestyle had prepared them well for the rigors of war; and they often 
thrived in conditions that would be considered intolerable by any other military of its time.  When the need arose they 
could last up to ten days at a time without cooking food, during which they would sustain themselves by drinking the blood 
of their horses.
^    Every victory wrought by the Mongols was followed by slaughters of incredible scale.  No citizens, with the exception of 
those who were useful to the Mongol war effort, were spared in these attacks.  In 1221 AD, the Islamic city of Merv was 
captured; 700,000 were murdered, and a rearguard was assembled to dispatch any citizens who were fortunate enough to have 
escaped the original slaughter, this was routine for the Mongol army.
^    By the end of the 13th century Mongol armies had been involved in action in countries including: Poland, Japan, Korea, 
Hungary, Russia, Palestine, Persia, India, Cambodia, Burma, and Vietnam.  After Temujin's death in 1227 five more Khans 
would follow, including, Kublai Khan, whose triumph was the union of all of China under his rule.  However, the death of 
Kublai Khan in 1294 AD marked the end of an era for Mongol conquests, and the march of Mongol armies was never again 
resumed, leaving its populace to be absorbed into the sedentary life style of the neighboring people.

^The Kingdom of Spain is located in the extreme southwest of the European continent, and occupies approximately 85-percent 
of the Iberian Peninsula.  Spain is bordered on the west by Portugal, in the Northeast by France, and by the great wall of the 
Pyrenees Mountains.  The Iberian Peninsula that the Spanish inhabited was occupied by various other civilizations, including 
the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, and Muslims, and Spain is now associated with having a very rich, eclectic 
culture as a result.
^    The development of Christian society and culture in the first 300 years following Islamic conquest in Spain was slow, but 
major changes occurred for the Spanish in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The population grew, communication with northern 
Europe intensified, commerce and urban life gained in importance, and the kingdoms of the Castile, Aragon, and Navarre, and 
Portugal emerged as the governing bodies of the Iberian Peninsula.  These kingdoms reached the frontiers that they would keep, 
with minimum amount of alteration, until the end of the Middle Ages, when {Isabella I} became Queen of Castile.
^    Isabella began participating in the royal court at the age of 13; and when Portugal, Aragon, and France offered their 
marriage candidates, she favored Ferdinand of Aragon.  Isabella ascended to the throne as Queen of Castile to rule sensibly 
and with a prudent political program.  Her unification of the states of the Iberian Peninsula into a single entity, the 
maintenance and control over the Strait of Gibraltar, policy of expansion into Muslim North Africa, reform of Spanish 
Catholicism, and support for the exploration and expansion in the unknown was evidence of her wisdom and capabilities as 
Queen.
^    On October 12, 1492 Columbus, with the blessing and financial backing of Isabella, sought a route to the legendary rich 
markets of China and Japan, but instead discovered what would become known as "The New World", the present day Americas.  This 
voyage gave way to a new golden age of expeditions and conquest, as the Americas contained gold, a valuable resource that Spain 
happened to be desperately bereft of at the time.

#DESC_RACE_Spanish
^
^
^
^    Following Columbus' lead, a Spanish military group known as $LINK<Los Conquistadores=PRTO_Conquistador>, 'The Conquerors', were directed by Hernan 
Cortes to the New World with the sole purpose of seeking out new frontiers and riches in the unknown.  The Conquistadores 
undertook their expeditions in the vast landmasses of the Americas at their own expense, risking their lives without aid from 
the Spanish royalty.  Their conquests included campaigns in Guatemala, Peru, Cuzco, Columbia, Chile, the Bay of Honduras, and 
as far as the Pacific Coastal regions.  The Conquistadors, however, were given to fighting and searching for gold, and were 
swiftly replaced by administrators and settlers from Spain who governed in their place.
^    Once the Spanish Kingdom established its presence in the Americas their operations inevitably became high-profile targets 
of pirates and other raiders who were endorsed by European powers such as England.  The Monarchy of Spain endeavored to 
retaliate by building an armada of warships that was dubbed "The Invincible Armada".  The armada was a collection of over 130 
naval warships and transport-ships, which contained approximately 8,000 seamen and 19,000 soldiers.  King Philip II directed 
this armada to invade England when the various and frequent raids on Spanish commerce in the Caribbean became intolerable.  
England's success in repelling the Spanish fleet saved England and the Netherlands from potential consolidation into the 
Spanish empire, but despite the armadas' defeat, the blow dealt by the Spanish upon England's reputation as the greatest 
European power was palpable.
^    Thereafter, Spain declined in power quickly; and by the 19th century, Spain became somewhat marginal in international 
politics.  Spain's period of imperial power and exploration left a legacy that consisted of 18 Latin American states, Puerto 
Rico, and the ever-growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States today.  In 1975 Spain transitioned into a 
constitutional monarchy by way of a democratic constitution and is now recognized for its eclectic culture as well as for 
the glory and mystique that it once possessed in its youth.

^
^The suggested reasons for the appearance of the Vikings at the end of the 8th century in Scandinavia are 
varied. The most logical explanation to date is the possible overpopulation of the region.  An explosion in 
Nordic population throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark during the 7th and 8th centuries may have 
forced the indigenous people to explore and settle in more favorable territories. In addition, the gradual 
establishment of government throughout most of Western Europe augmented mercantile trade greatly as well as the 
opportunities for piracy. At home, these Scandinavians were independent farmers, but at sea or on the fields of 
war they were some of the fiercest warriors in the world.
^    The Scandinavian art of shipbuilding evolved during the course of the 8th century and greatly facilitated these 
early Viking expeditions and raids.  The most distinct differences between the Viking ships and their merchant 
vessel victims, was that the merchant ships were short, broad and relied on sail power, while Viking warships 
were longer, thinner and had a far greater number of oars and men. This made the Viking ships notably faster, 
and was instrumental in allowing the Vikings to penetrate long distances up rivers. Small armies of Viking 
longships negotiated the seas, utilizing hit-and-run tactics on the cities, towns, and villages that dotted the 
coasts of Europe. These longships were the very tools of Viking expansion.  The Vikings were able to raid far 
afield and subsequently colonize the lands that they plundered.
^    Viking hordes attacked England at the end of the 8th century, after which followed a period of relative calm 
that was shattered years later when attacks began anew. At first, the Vikings led nothing more than predatory 
raids in the summer months in search of booty and slaves, with no attempts at permanent settlement.  Beginning in 850 
however, there appeared to be changes in Viking strategy, for the first time, Vikings occupied entire villages 
and regions in the winters following their raids... they had come to stay.
#DESC_RACE_Vikings

^
^    In 865 a massive fleet arrived that carried some of the fiercest Viking leaders, including sons of the Danish 
{King Ragnar Lodbrok} ("Hairy-Breeches"), whose family was regarded as representing the very epitome of true
Vikings. Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan, and Ubbi (or 'Hubba') brought military ambitions with them.  
Ragnar's sons captured York at the end of 867; and then proceeded to overrun most of Northumbria, Anglia, and 
Mercia. Ivar advanced to Dublin to conquer it, later dying in the Battle of Ashdown in 871. Halfdan became the 
chief leader following Ivar, where he defeated the English at Basing, Meretun, Reading, and Wilton. For the next 
few years the Vikings concentrated on securing conquests in eastern and northern England. They divided Northumbria 
and Mercia amongst themselves, and Halfdan followed in Ivar's footsteps in another attempt to secure Dublin from 
Ireland, only to be defeated by Norwegian Vikings in 877.
^    The Scandinavian countries seemed to possess an inexhaustible supply of able-bodied warriors and manpower.  In 
land battles Vikings favored overlapping shield-wall formations, which consisted of approximately 5 or more ranks 
deep of the most heavily armed and armored Vikings forming the exterior of a line, wedge, or circle formation to 
absorb the brunt of enemy attacks. In the pagan era, before Scandinavia was converted to Christianity, the 
{berserkir} warriors were looked upon as possessing supernatural powers attributed to the Viking's chief god, Odin; 
and a belief in lycanthropy. These warriors were known to rush into battle without armor, as mad as wolves, and 
as strong as wild boars. This infamous berserkir frenzy reportedly allowed them to kill men in single blows with 
great bearded axes, and shrug off blows from fire and iron alike.  Today it is believed that these frenzies were 
the result of epileptic attacks.
^    The era of the Viking lasted only 300 years, ending at approximately 1066AD; around the time of the approximated 
death of Harald Hardrada, who died heroically in battle.  Harald has been dubbed 'the last Viking'. Most 
remaining Viking conquests and exploits never amounted to those of their predecessors, and Viking lineage 
gradually integrated into their surrounding civilizations.

^
^In the 1st century BC, Strabo wrote of the Celts: 'The whole race... is madly fond of war, high-spirited and 
quick to battle... and on whatever pretext you stir them up, you will have them ready to face danger, even if they 
have nothing on their side but their own strength and courage'.  Much of what we know about Celtic culture today 
has been derived from the insights of the various writers and geographers of the time; coupled with finds from 
Celtic burial sights located in Bavaria, Bohemia, and Upper Austria.  The Celts once formed a loose-knit 
'empire', inhabiting territory that stretched in a chaotic band across central Europe.  The writings and 
findings of modern archeologists place Celtic civilization as ranging from the Atlantic Coast of the British 
Isles and northern Spain, to as far east as Transylvania and the Black Sea.
^    The Celts lived as extended families, or clans, which banded together, in order to form larger tribes that 
would occupy territory together.  A Knight and a High Chieftain typically governed these tribes, while a third 
privileged class known as 'men of art', who are better known today as the Druids and Bards, extolled the feats 
of Celtic warriors in song and craft.  Celtic society was held together by a complex web of family ties and 
other obligations, within which, the warrior nobles would strive to attain wealth and prestige through 
agriculture, trade, and success in war; which they often used to create and fund their own family or tribe.
^    At the age of fourteen, Celtic boys attained manhood and were permitted to bear arms, while girls became 
eligible for marriage.  Young nobles and sons of freemen who reached their fourteenth birthday became clients 
of a famous lord or well-reputed Celtic Knight.  Such warrior retinues were called 'Fianna'.  These junior 
warriors sought out and followed experienced warriors whose success could provide them with greater chances 
at their own wealth and glory.
^    While the bulk of a Celtic army would typically consist of poorly armored spearmen, it was the warrior 
nobles who wielded swords that were the most feared.  These {Gallic Swordsmen} were wealthier than their peers, 
and could afford to equip themselves not only 
#DESC_RACE_Celts
^
^
^with their slashing and stabbing sword, but also with a helmet and shield.  They often charged into battle 
bare-chested or completely naked, occasionally wearing vividly patterned pants or cloaks.  Similar to the 
Viking Berserker, they began their battles by viciously taunting their enemies, and followed it with a mad 
rush against enemy lines.  This was standard behavior for skirmishes between clans, which were frequent in 
Celtic society.  These tribal conflicts provided starting points for young Celts who sought to openly display 
their bravery and skill as a warrior.  Celtic warriors were also known to serve as mercenaries to numerous 
armies of the classical period.  The best known of instance of this, is when Celtic mercenaries joined Hannibal 
in his invasion of Italy during the 2nd Punic War, contributing to victories against Rome.
^    The Celts' previous capture and sack of Rome, headed by {Brennus}, also remained an indelible mark on Roman 
folk memory, and was likely the instigator for Rome's merciless treatment of the Celts in subsequent wars.  
This mutual hostility did not cease until the Gauls and Britons were later formally incorporated into the Roman 
Empire.
^    Despite the writings and other information that paints the Celts as uncultured savages, the relatively 
sophisticated weapons, pottery, jewelry, and other equipment found at burial sites serves to remind us that 
they were very far from being the savages they were once depicted as.  On the contrary, it in fact 
appears that the Celts maintained a rich culture that is survived by the modern Celtic and Gallic speakers of 
Ireland, Highland Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales and Brittany.

^
^Carthaginians were 8th century BC Phoenician emigrants who fled from the Persian-held city of Tyre and sought to fashion 
their own identity in the fertile peninsula of northern Africa.  The effort of these refugees was realized in the foundation 
of Carthage.  The Romans knew the people of Carthage as "Poeni", a derivation of the word "Phoenicians", from which the 
adjective "Punic" is also derived.  Carthage is located in modern-day Tunisia, bordered by Algeria, Libya, and the 
Mediterranean Sea.  Located roughly center of the triangular Cap Bon peninsula, it is surrounded by low hills and backed 
by the lake of Tunis, allowing for safe anchorage and an abundant supply of fish.  The resulting city site was well 
protected, and easily defensible.  Carthaginian control extended as far southwest as Theveste in northern Algeria; 
throughout which, a thriving agriculture developed.
^    The actual stages of growth in Carthaginian power are unknown, but the process was largely complete by the start of 
the 4th century BC.  Ancient sources indicate that Carthage had perhaps become the richest city in the world via trade in 
perishable goods such as textiles, un-worked metals, food, and slaves.  Tin, silver, gold, and iron were obtained in 
exchange for these manufactured and consumer goods.  Carthage maintained a monopoly of trade from the 6th to 3rd century 
BC by sinking all intruders and exacting recognition of its position from neighboring Mediterranean states.  This wealth 
was attested by the vast mercenary armies it was able to maintain with a mintage of gold coins far exceeding that known 
for any other advanced state of its time. 
^    While frequently led by Carthaginian soldiers, the majority of the Carthaginian armies was comprised of mercenaries.  
Celts and Iberians contributed large numbers of infantry and horsemen, but {Numidian Infantry} dominated their ranks.  These 
Numidian mercenaries were equipped with loot from assorted engagements against Rome, and were generally regarded as capable 
soldiers and spearmen.
^    The First Punic War between Rome and Carthage resulted from attempts to garner control over lands and trade routes 
through Corsica and Sicily.  Carthaginians intervened in a dispute between the

#DESC_RACE_Carthaginians
^
^
^two principal cities on the Sicilian coast, Messana and Syracuse, in order to establish their presence on the island.  Rome 
responded by attacking Messana, forcing the Carthaginians to withdraw and later surrender, ceding Sicily and the Lipari 
islands to Rome.  The great Carthaginian general, Hamilcar, led Carthage against Rome in the First Punic War, and his son 
{Hannibal} was made to swear eternal hostility against Rome at an early age as well.  From the death of Hamilcar in 229 BC 
until his own death in 183 BC, Hannibal's life was one of constant struggle against the Roman Republic.  Hannibal made 
good on his oath by instigating a second Punic war.
^    During the Second Punic War Hannibal established base in Spain, from which he could wage war against Rome.  Hannibal 
refused Rome's demand to withdraw from the Iberian Peninsula, and Rome renewed war on Carthage once again.  Rome controlled 
the Sea, forcing Hannibal to lead his army overland through Spain, Gaul, and the Alps to reach Rome.  After this spectacular
achievement, Hannibal undermined Rome through battlefield tactics and shrewd political maneuvering.  Once Hannibal's hold 
over northern Italy was established he maintained it until 203 BC, when he was ordered to return to Africa.  Roman forces 
maintained pressure on Carthaginian strongholds, however, and eventually forced the Carthaginians out of Spain.  Carthage 
accepted the terms of peace, surrendering its navy and ceded Spain as well as the Mediterranean islands to Rome.
^    The first and second Punic wars effectively deprived Carthage of its political power, but did nothing to quell its 
commercial trade, which continued to expand rapidly.  This inevitably drew the envy of Rome's growing mercantile community, 
and was reason enough for the Roman Republic to goad the people of Carthage into one final war.  Despite determined and 
ingenious resistance against a siege that lasted for two years, Carthage fell.  The third and final war between the Roman 
Republic and the Carthaginians resulted in the final destruction of Carthage, the enslavement of its population, and Roman 
hegemony over the western Mediterranean.

^Fables and legends that feature the origins of the Ottoman Empire indicate that {Osman}, a Turkish tribesman, 
was the original ruler responsible for founding the civilization that nearly brought Christian Europe to its 
knees.  Narratives indicate that Osman's tribe, the Kayi, fled west from the Mongols in the 13th century and took 
control of a freebooting army of nomads and Muslim peasants who inhabited the rugged stretch of wasteland along 
the Byzantine frontier.  This band of refugees enjoyed close ties to Muslim guilds and religious brotherhoods in 
local towns that were led by Sheikh Edebali, who allowed Osman to form a tiny state around his castle of 
Karacahisar.  Turkish warriors and religious leaders who also fled from the pagan Mongols in the east quickly 
populated this region, ruled by Osman.  Osman directed his community through the Kara Su valley to seize 
Yenisehir, and establish it as the first true Ottoman capital.  The Ottoman state emerged, poised above the 
fertile shores of the Sea of Marmara.
^    Osman continued to wage a slow but persistent war against the Byzantine Empire who endeavored to defend 
their territories along the Asiatic shores that were opposite of Constantinople (now Istanbul).  His first 
victory over a Byzantine army at Koyunhisar in 1301 AD perpetuated Osman's fame, and settlers flocked to Ottoman 
territory as a result.  Osman extended his control over several other Byzantine fortresses, providing the 
Ottomans with strong bases from which they could lay siege to Bursa and Nicaea in northwest Anatolia.  The 
pinnacle of Osman's reign occurred at the conquest of Bursa shortly before his death.
^    Initially, Ottoman war tactics were no different than those used by the tribal Turks.  They would first 
harass the foe with horse-archers, employing hit and run tactics, only closing in on the enemy when they became 
completely disorganized.  Thus, the earliest Ottoman successes were won against isolated Byzantine garrisons, 
but rarely against a field army.  In order to capture fortified towns the Ottomans ravaged the countryside and 
imposed blockades.  Afterwards, the Ottomans would revive the town's trade and increase its population so that 
it could then be consolidated into the Empire as a productive

^
^and functioning city.  During their earliest exploits, the Ottomans were frequently frustrated by fortifications 
and the exhausting sieges that were required in order to overcome these defenders.  This changed in the 15th 
century and beyond as imported expertise in firearms and gunpowder led to some of the most massive artillery of 
the time.  A form of Turkish heavy cavalry, known as {Sipahi}, became the predominating military unit utilized by 
the Ottoman Empire.  The earliest variations of these soldiers were well-armored men on well-armored horses, 
who typically used a mace as their primary weapon.  During the 17th century the Sipahi replaced their archaic 
weaponry with sabers and pistols, establishing them as a fearsome presence on the battlefield.  While European 
infantry were more than a match for the standard Ottoman infantry, the Sipahi were far superior to any 
medieval knights.
^    During their period of expansion, the Ottomans visualized Europe as Americans would later see their Western 
frontier: a land of destiny.  The conquest of Istanbul in 1453 AD initiated this by uniting Muslim Anatolia and
Christian Rumelia under the Ottoman Sultan's protection.  However, this attitude would change as the Ottomans 
were forced to go on the defensive during the 17th and 18th centuries.  Ottoman defeats were followed by mass 
slaughters of Muslim minorities.  These massacres characterized the war between Christian and Turk in the 19th 
century.
^    At its height, the Ottoman Empire territory included Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, Greece, the 
Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Egypt, a large section of North Africa, and most of the Arabian Peninsula.  Over 
time, however, Sultans grew weary of their administrative duties and withdrew from public affairs.  The office of 
Grand Vizier was created to act second only to the sultan in authority and revenue, but while the Grand Vizier 
was able to stand in for the sultan in an official capacity, he could not take his place as a focus of loyalty 
among the different classes and social groups in the empire.  This separation of political loyalty and 
centralized authority led to a decline in the government's ability to impose its will, which inevitably led to 
the Ottoman Empire's end in 1922, when it was replaced by the Turkish Republic.

^    During the 7th century AD, Muhammad emerged as the prophet for the religion of Islam, which was widely adopted 
by the Arab community. Islam unified the Bedouins and the town-dwellers of the oases, and within a century, spread 
throughout most of the present day Arab-speaking world.  The newfound social organization that followed Islam 
offered new possibilities for the Arabs as agricultural production and intercity trading, particularly in luxury 
goods, saw significant increases.  Gradually, the triad of temple, court, and market formed, as well as a 
standardized style of writing for laws and other texts.  New institutions also emerged, including: coinage, 
territorial deities, royal priesthoods, and standing armies, which further enhanced Arab power.  Adherence to the 
religion of Islam has become a global phenomenon.  Muslims predominate in approximately 30 to 40 countries, from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific and along a belt that stretches across northern Africa into Central Asia and the northern 
regions of the Indian subcontinent.  Despite the absence of any large-scale Islamic political entities, the Islamic 
faith continues to expand, by some estimates faster than any other major religion.
^    By proclaiming his message publicly, Muhammad gained followers.  {Abu Bakr} is noted as being the first male 
convert to Islam and also as Muhammad's closest companion and advisor.  At the point of Muhammad's death, on June 
8th, 632 AD Muslims resolved the crisis of succession by accepting Abu Bakr as the first Caliph.  In his rule as

^Caliph, Abu Bakr suppressed tribal, political, and religious uprisings, known as the Rida Wars, and brought central 
Arabia under Muslim control.  These wars caused high casualties among the Islamic community, but through them, 
Abu Bakr not only ensured the survival of Islam, but also established himself as the undisputed leader of the entire 
Arabian Peninsula. By undertaking direct expansion from Arabia into Iraq and Syria, he began the Muslim conquests 
otherwise known as 'Jihad'.  Aside from Iraq and Syria these conquests penetrated regions including Anatolia, Nubia, 
Libya, and Iran.  While early Muslim forces consisted of very few soldiers, it's understood that they retained higher 
morale and mobility than their enemies, as well as the luxury to retreat into the desert where they alone knew the 
location of water and grazing land.  The one military unit that was present in nearly all of the Arabic expansion of 
the 7th to 9th centuries was the {Ansar Warrior}.  These warriors participated as infantry, but most commonly rode on 
horseback.  The quality of the Arabian horses quickly led to these soldiers dominating the battlefield, making ample 
use of their array of weaponry, which consisted of javelins, a sword, as well as bow and arrows.  Jihad is the only 
type of war legitimized by Islam, yet the word itself is still misunderstood by Westerners.  'Holy War' is the 
often-used misleading translation of Jihad, which in fact is meant to consist of an individual's or a communal 
'struggle' against evil, within one's self, and in order to protect Islam, but never as a tool for conversion.
^    Traditional Arab values have since been modified in the 20th century through the combined pressures of 
urbanization, industrialization, and Western influences.  While urban Arabs still tend to identify themselves 
more by nationality than by tribe, village farmers revere the pastoral nomad's romantic way of life and claim a 
kinship with the great desert tribes of the past.  As heirs to the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians, 
Hebrews, even to the Greeks and Indians, the societies created by Muslims bridge time and space.  The original 
Arab tribes in less than 20 years after Muhammad's death defeated the Byzantine and Persian empires, occupied a 
vast territory from Libya to Persia, and then developed into the Arab, or Islamic, Empire known today.

^Long before 3000 BC, the tribal immigrants of Manchuria and Siberia settled along the coasts and river valleys of the 
modern-day Korean peninsula.  These settlers were the original founders of what we know today as the Korean civilization.  
The immigrant tribes solidified into three rival kingdoms: Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla; and nearly simultaneously, the 
kingdoms achieved a complete centralization of power through wars of expansion, organized military systems, training 
institutions, and tribal aristocracies assembled within the capital cities.  The maturation of monarchies in the kingdoms 
eventually eliminated the influence of the aristocracies, however, and the balance of power waxed and waned as each kingdom 
endeavored to unite Korea under their exclusive rule.
^    By 935 AD a general named {Wang Kon} established the Koryo dynasty, which ruled the Korean peninsula until 1392 AD.  Koryo, 
from which the western word "Korea" is derived, was proclaimed as the successor to all of the conquered kingdoms and states.  
It was during the Koryo dynasty that Korea began to construct its own distinct cultural identity among the rest of the East-
Asian civilizations.  A bureaucratic system was created in order to replace the archaic tribal system that had previously 
governed the country, and civil service examinations were utilized as a means to select only the most capable officials and 
provincial magnates.  The new bureaucratic force reaped by the civil service examinations held the applied precepts of Buddhism 
in disdain however, and with the assistance of Confucian-scholar General Yi Song-gye, the disgruntled officials seized power 
and established reforms that brought about the end of the Koryo dynasty, replacing the Buddhist-based system with Confucianism.  
The Yi dynasty named Hanyang (modern day Seoul) as the new capital of Korea, and operated from it for approximately 500 years 
until the Japanese annexation of Korea occurred in 1910.
^    During the reign of the Koryo and Choson / Yi dynasties the advent of popular arts, as well as the introduction of 
Roman Catholicism in the 17th and 18th centuries, propelled Korea even closer to the modern state that exists today.  A 
series of changes transpired that
#DESC_RACE_Koreans
^
^
^would impact virtually every sector of Korean society.  Korean agriculture prospered as farming technology advanced.  
The cultivation of special crops such as tobacco and ginseng became possible, providing new and profitable trade products 
which consequently improved the standard of living for peasants drastically.  The government began to mint coins and collect 
farm rent in cash.  Markets were established across the country, creating a national trade network.  Scholars switched focus 
from theory and speculation to matters of practical relevance, including the needs of society and state, while popular 
literature and artistic works also came into fashion.
^    At the onset of World War II in 1941, Japan attempted to obliterate Korea as a nation.  Hundreds of thousands of Koreans 
were drafted to fight and work for Japan during the war while the Japanese continued to commit numerous atrocities upon the 
Korean populace.  The Korean provisional government organized the Korean Restoration Army to fight alongside Allied forces in 
China until August of 1945, when Japan surrendered.
^    The end of Japanese rule caused great political confusion among the liberated Korean population. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. 
supervised the permanent removal of Japanese forces and government from Korea, dividing it along the 38th parallel and sharing 
the task.  The Soviet army, however, was accompanied by a group of expatriated Korean Communists who were placed into key 
positions of power.  The Soviet Union installed a Communist-controlled government in the North, which adopted the political 
structure of the Soviet Union.  This new agency became the only lawful Korean government recognized by the U.S.S.R, essentially 
declaring war upon South Korea.  South Korea was largely unprepared to resist a total invasion; aware of this, the U.S. 
Congress approved monetary and military aid to support South Korea.  The resulting war lasted for approximately three years, but 
in that time over two-fifths of Korea's industrial facilities, and one-third of its homes were destroyed.  On July 27, 1953 an 
armistice was arranged establishing a cease-fire and a demilitarized zone between the two Korean factions, which still exists 
today.

^
^The Sumerians were, by historical consensus, the first human civilization. Originally from Asia Minor, they settled between the 
Tigris and Euphrates (in modern-day Iraq) and began to farm and create simple goods. They relied on a sort of theocratic city-state government, 
where each Sumerian city worshipped a separate god and had a separate governor, although all paid tribute to a single King in the capital, Ur.
^    Sumeria's first and greatest accomplishment was the extent to which its people controlled their environment. They drained swamps, dug canals, 
and generally bent the Euphrates region to their needs. They plowed the land for the first time in history, and took advantage of the rich, fertile 
Mesopotamia soil. However, the area was low on other resources, so the Sumerian city-states were forced to import goods (particularly metals). Thus they 
had to create a barter system of trade, as well as riverboats to more easily traverse the rivers that flanked their home. The invention of the plow led in 
turn to the invention of the wheel, which permitted animals to pull carts as well as plow fields, and also to the creation of better pottery (with potters' 
wheels).
^    Since specialists were now able to create goods, and not every man had to farm, full-time priests could administer community affairs as well as the 
temples in each city. To support them, in turn, people had time to devise picture signs and other very early alphabets, and being a full-time scribe became a 
viable profession. The literature of Sumeria followed thereafter, culminating in the Epic of {Gilgamesh}, a lengthy poem dedicated to the mythic god-king whose 
real and legendary exploits blend together. A companion of Gilgamesh, Enkidu, fought by Gilgamesh's side in many battles, and for him the {Enkidu Warriors} are 
named: fierce fighters who sought to defend Sumerian lands from the other civilizations being born nearby.
#DESC_RACE_Sumeria
^
^
^    The literature of the Sumerians was not limited to stories, though.  In fact, one fact of modern life is still as Sumeria designed it.  The Sumerian priesthood 
developed an early mathematics for commercial and religious purposes, and their number system was based around the number 60.  Thus time itself is divided into units of 
60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and so forth. The 24-hour day also originates with Sumerian calendars, as does the 360-degree circle.  So the fingerprints 
of the world's most ancient civilization are still visible today.
^    Sumeria's end came gradually, as barbarians saw what they had achieved and strove to emulate it.  About 1,500 years after the first Sumerian cities took form, 
Amorite nomads settled near Ur in a place called Babylon. The resulting civilization grew into a mighty kingdom in its own right, and when Elamite invaders (from modern-day 
Iran) sacked Ur, Babylon (which then still styled itself Akkad) saw its opportunity to eclipse its sire. They went in, dispersed the Elamites, and rebuilt Ur in their 
own image. Sumerian culture and language persisted, but slowly assimilated into the new dominant empire. Sumeria disappeared completely as an autonomous culture by 1900 BC.

^Compared to other great kingdoms of the Middle East, little is known of Hatti, and what is known is often derived from 
sources in other contemporary kingdoms (such as Egypt). The Hatti, or Hittite, Empire was one of the great powers of Mesopotamia, 
rivaling Babylon and Egypt in military strength and influence. The first Hittites probably came from somewhere in the Caucasus or 
Russia, but settled in central Turkey and later in Syria, areas whose plentiful natural resources, particularly metals, would prove 
crucial to the power of Hatti. Early Hittite kings focused on consolidating their power in their chosen region, but {Mursilis I} 
proved more ambitious, opting to strike out and execute audacious raids against mighty Babylon. He had great success, and indeed 
was able to undermine and destroy the ruling Amorite dynasty in Babylon -- the family from which most great Babylonian kings 
(including Hammurabi) came.
^    When Mursilis was assassinated, a bloody struggle for the kingship followed; the eventual victor, Telipinus, formed his 
own legal code which helped mitigate later power plays. After that, the Hittite Empire fought brief wars with its neighbors, 
until the time for a reckoning with Egypt came. The famed battle of Kadesh, in 1299 BC, is one of the most well-known Bronze Age 
battles. The Pharaoh {Ramses II} moved into Palestine with a large army of chariots and infantry, to be met by a Hittite force 
of equal size (yet also composed partly of {three-man chariots}, a much larger variant of the first wheeled fighting vehicles, which 
permitted the riders to fight hand-to-hand as well as at a distance). The Hittites were able to surprise the Egyptians near dusk, 
and only a dramatic force march by the Pharaoh's reserves prevented the total destruction of the Egyptian army. The Hittites were 
forced to retreat, but given the casualties they suffered, the Egyptians were unable to capitalize on the Hittite retreat and Ramses' 
overall objective, Egyptian control of Palestine and Syria, was not achieved.
^    The Hittites are also suspected by archaeologists to be the first smelters of iron. During Hittite primacy, around 1250 BC, 
the Iron Age began in Turkey, with the Hittites able to remove impurities

^
^
^from iron to finally produce a metal strong enough to use 
for weapons. The technique caught on very quickly, adding to the Hittites' already substantial wealth. They were not able to exploit 
this advantage for long, though, as the other regional kingdoms could not afford to allow Hatti a monopoly on iron weapons.
^	The end of the Hittite Empire came around 1100 BC, when mass migrations from Europe and the Caucasus caused the Empire to 
dissolve into dozens of small, semi-autonomous city-states. These city-states, in turn, were easily absorbed by upstart Assyria, 
which itself would dominate the Middle East for centuries thereafter.

^Austria, located in lower Central Europe north of the Balkans, first coalesced as a nation in the early Middle Ages by the margrave 
Leopold of Babenberg, a regional noble who in the 10th century C.E. pushed the Magyars from that area and formalized a system of common law.  
But it was not until three hundred years later that Austria would take the first steps towards great power status.  A Hungarian noble, Otakar II, 
took advantage of a succession dispute in 1254 and married into the Babenberg line.  As a response, the German nobility in Bavaria and elsewhere 
felt concerned, and began a long campaign to undermine and eventually depose Otakar.  The German army's commander, a relatively obscure noble from a minor family, was then elected king of Germany to 
reward his successes.  His name was Rudolf of Hapsburg.  The Hapsburgs would become one of Europe's most powerful families; the seat of their power was 
Austria.
^    In 1519 Martin Luther posted his famous 95 Theses, and at the time the Hapsburg emperor was {Charles V}, a devout Catholic and harsh ruler.  Forced to rule 
two essentially foreign countries -- Austria and Spain -- Charles did his best, but made many mistakes and alienated many nobles before he was able to successfully 
ride two of Europe's strongest horses at once.  Moreover, Charles' fervent opposition to Protestantism as well as his well-founded concerns regarding the Hapsburg 
rights in western Europe diverted his attention from the threat of the Ottoman Turks (whose ships already ruled the Mediterranean).  He used severe measures to put down 
rebellions in lower Austria and in the Netherlands, and even allowed an unpaid and hungry army to sack Rome over a grudge against the Pope.  Nonetheless, Charles 
dealt successfully with a huge number of threats, minor and major, to the Austrian empire, and he also managed to keep the Turks at bay.  He even managed to expand the 
empire, by acquiring the Portuguese succession rights.  His greatest ambition, to bring all Protestants back into the Church, was obviously a failure, although he made 
several sincere (and even nonviolent) attempts to bring this about.
^    After Charles' death, the empire steadily grew, adding Bohemia to the northeast.  The new Emperor, Ferdinand, wished to extend his 
#DESC_RACE_Austria
^
^
^influence and rule further into Germany.  The result was the Thirty Years' War, in which the great powers of Europe took advantage of religious strife 
to expand their influence.  Austria did not do well in the end, and lost territory and huge amounts of money in the war and ensuing treaty.
^    Austria continued to play a major role in European and world politics through the nineteenth century, attempting to slow the rise of Prussia in Germany, 
and acting as a key member of the coalition opposing Napoleon.  The Austrian army adopted the style and dress of the Hungarian light cavalry, and these 
fast, deadly horsemen came to be known as {hussars}.  Hussars quickly became part of virtually every European army's order of battle, and some still fight today.
^    Since 1700 Austria has been (and remains) a focal point of European culture and learning.  History's greatest composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, created his works 
for the Austrian emperor.  The Vienna Circle, an influential group of philosophers and mathematicians, sparked the "logical positivist" movement, which sought to unify philosophy with 
natural science.  At the same time, the economist Carl Menger founded the Austrian school of economics, which emphasized qualitative analysis of human action.
^    The first among many of the twentieth century's tragedies began in Austria, with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian nationalists.  When the Serbian 
government refused Austria's outrageous demands, Austria declared war on Serbia.  This sparked the chain of events leading to World War I, which would consume millions of lives 
and leave Europe's great empires in ruins and revolution.  The Hapsburg empire was no exception, and its final collapse came at this time.
^    After World War I, Central Europe was broken into many different countries.  Austria was ruled by a series of authoritarian regimes until it was annexed by one even 
moreso -- Hitler's Germany.  After a period of military rule, Austria became a full-fledged republic in 1955.  Today Austria is known as a repository of European culture and 
tradition, despite its struggles with its Nazi past; its churches and universities are among Europe's most prestigious, especially in the arts.

^The Byzantine Empire was first known as the eastern Roman empire, when Constantine I relocated the Roman capital from Rome
to Constantinople and his successor Valentinian I made the division between Western and Eastern Empire official.  When barbarians 
sacked Rome and defeated the western armies a century later, the Byzantine Empire was the final bulwark of Roman civilization to stand
against the increasing pressure from European barbarians to the north and Persia in the east.  Byzantine government was based largely on 
that of Rome, although unlike Roman emperors a Byzantine emperor was elected by a threefold vote of the senate, the people, and the army.  
To govern the empire, Byzantine emperors relied on a labyrinthine system of advisors, ministries, and offices -- hence the pejorative "Byzantine" today, used to 
describe overly hierarchical and intrigue-prone systems.
^    The golden age of Byzantium began when Justinian I and his brilliant wife {Theodora} became emperor and empress.  Under their rule, the Byzantine 
general Belisarius undertook a series of dramatic and successful campaigns against the barbarian kingdoms that had risen in the ruins of Rome.  
After earning imperial favor by ruthlessly quashing a popular revolt, Belisarius successfully fought the Ostrogoths in Italy, the Persians, and various 
tribes in North Africa.  His enormous popularity eventually caused Justinian to fear him, and he was eventually stripped of his command.
^    Byzantine military reform came mostly during the reign of Heraclius, the son of Africa's imperial governor.  Arriving in Constantinople 
to restore order after a disastrous interregnum (marred by assassination, intrigue, and civil disorder), Heraclius placed tremendous power in the 
hands of the army.  It was also during the reign of Heraclius that Greek fire, the medieval precursor to napalm, was invented, and used extensively by 
Byzantine ships called {dromons} in battle against Persian and barbarian ships.  Heraclius also ordered the army to emulate the 
barbarian horse archers previously employed as mercenaries; the result was the cataphract, a heavily armored cavalryman who could fight with bow, sword, or lance.
#DESC_RACE_Byzantines

^    After two hundred years of defeats and erosion, during which Byzantium lost virtually all of its possessions south of Asia Minor, the ascension 
of Basil I to the imperial throne in 867 marked a turnaround in Byzantine military fortunes.  Byzantine armies beat back the Arabs in the east and south, and despite 
several humiliating defeats at the hands of the Muslims, reasserted dominance over the eastern Mediterranean.  Syria, along
with the key city of Antioch, also came back to Byzantine control, along with Armenia and large parts of the Balkans.  For 150 years, Byzantium enjoyed civil 
prosperity and military victory.
^    But new adversaries appeared where the old ones had fallen.  In 1071, Byzantium suffered two catastrophic defeats -- they lost their last toehold in Italy to the Normans, who had 
earlier sacked Constantinople during a crusade gone awry.  In the east, the Ottomans broke Byzantine power in Asia Minor forever at Manzikert, and the once dominant 
empire was reduced to a rump state comprising Constantinople, parts of the Balkans, and a few remaining provinces in western Turkey.  The heart of it, though, was 
now ruled by the Turks.  Nonetheless, during this time, art, religion, and philosophy flourished within the walls of Constantinople.  It was as if the learned men
of Byzantium were unaware of the threats lurking outside.  Another fateful event, the Schism of 1054, finalized the separation between the Byzantine (Eastern) and
Catholic (western) churches.  This would lead to deep suspicion between the two churches, and western reluctance to assist Byzantium against the Turks years later.
^    Eventually Byzantium was forced to resort to bribery and compromise with the Turks and the new western powers that coveted its territory and former influence. 
In 1421, after a hundred years of co-existence with the Turks, the new sultan Murad II revoked all of the arrangements that had existed between the two empires.  As a 
last resort, the Byzantine emperor begged Rome for help, but the Christian army sent to fight the Turks was utterly defeated.  In 1453, the Turks assaulted 
Constantinople itself, and the walls that had stood for over a thousand years finally fell, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.

^Hundreds of years ago, a group of people calling themselves the [Inca] settled the Cuzco Valley high in the Andes Mountains of South America. Where they had come from was a mystery. Yet, though their purpose for settling such a rugged and inhospitable landscape was unclear, the end result of their arrival is without doubt. In time, the Inca built an empire that spanned the Pacific coast (as far south as Argentina and as far north as Ecuador), some 2,000 miles of hills, mountains, valleys and coastline. I
n just a short time (roughly 100 years), the Incan empire dominated South America and is, to this day, considered one of the finest empires the world has ever known. Beginning with the ninth ruler, {Pachacuti} Inca Yupanqui, the Inca began their 
expansion. Pachacuti won his first military campaign against the Chanca people, where he refused to retreat despite insurmountable odds. From there, he consolidated his control over his cultural base, Cuzco, then moved north into the Urubamba Valley, which extended beyond the site where the lost city of Mach Picchu was later built. He then turned his army south and conquered the Colla and Lupaca tribes. Though not the first Incan ruler, Pachacuti was by many accounts one of the finest Pre-Columbian persons 
that ever lived. A great military strategist, an architect, a skilled diplomat and a gifted religious philosopher, his teachings are still practiced by many Andeans today. 
^    Like many other groups that preceded the Inca (the Chimu, the Nazca, the Moche), 
Incan society was heavily dipped in the worship of powerful gods. Their pantheon contained such lofty omnipotents as Viracocha (the god of creation), Inti (the sun and father of the Inca Dynasty), Illapa (god of rain, thunder, and lightening), Pacha Mama 
(mother of the earth), and Mama Cocha (mother of the lakes). Grand ceremonies were held frequently to honor these gods, for the Inca believed that if one did not give thanks and obedience to the gods, bad things would happen. The world of the Andes Mountains is full of ecological wonders [and] ecological disasters: Earthquakes, severe storms, and 
volcanic activity. The gods held sway with these events and thus the proper respect had to be paid at all times.

#DESC_RACE_INCANS
^    The Inca called their empire Tahuantinsuyu (“Land of the Four Quarters”), which was divided into four provinces. Each province was controlled by a local governor called the [apu]; below him were the local rulers - the [curacas], and even lower still
the district headsmen - the [camayoc]. Through this governmental structure, the [Sapa-Inca] could rule the empire with impunity. Additional structures were also put in place, such as the Imperial road system, which was built along the steep inclines of mountains, interspersing bridges and stone walkways, stone steps and flat brick highways. To rule such a vast realm, the Sapa-Inca also needed constant information
 about the status of the far-flung reaches of the kingdom. To provide this information, the Inca formed the {Chasqui Scout} system. Chasquis delivered messages across the empire, relaying (by memory) important information from point to point. And in this
 way, a message about a peasant uprising hundreds of miles north of Cuzco could reach the king within a matter of days. Chasquis were also used by the army on campaigns to deliver messages between the moving columns. In addition, way-stations known as
 [tambos] were constructed at strategic points along the roads, giving travelers and important dignitaries a place to rest and prepare for the next leg of their journey. 
^    The Incan army was also well organized. When called upon to fight, each province would muster squadrons of men armed with maces, bows and arrows, slings, darts, and
 spears. During a battle, slingers would let fly a shower of rocks to soften the enemy lines. Then, archers would release their shafts, darts would fly, and then the shock troops would hit, in a torrent of screams and shouts meant to confuse and terrify the wavering opposition. Incan warfare was very successful. But nothing could prepare the
 empire for what was coming. 
^    After the glorious rise of Pachacuti and his son, Topa Inca, the empire began to erode under a series of internal and external disasters. A bitter civil war between half brothers Huascar and Atahuallpa stretched the empire to the breaking point. Atahuallpa won the war, quickly killed his half-brother, and declared himself king.
 But, in 1532 AD, Spanish Conquistadors, under the command of Francisco Pizarro, entered the Cajamarca Valley, brutally attacked Atahuallpa and his subjects, killing many and taking the Sapa-Inca hostage. Eventually, Pizarro killed Atahuallpa, pillaged
 the empire of its riches, and brought an end to the mighty Incan civilization.

^The Mayan civilization of ancient Mesoamerica is shrouded in mystery. The Maya developed their unique culture in one of the most inhospitable places on earth. The lowlands of northern Guatemala, western Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan peninsula, are hot and humid, teeming with jungles boasting an annual average rainfall of 120
 inches. And yet, these stalwart peoples toughed it out and forged a civilization that stands, to this day, as a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of ancient man. 
^    Where did the Maya originate? The earliest archeological evidence was discovered
 in and around Belize, and dates as far back as 1200 BC. Primitive tools and pottery, small religious figurines of animals and humans became abundant, and by 900 BC, small
 villages of one-room dwellings made of poles lashed together with henequen rope, began to appear everywhere. By 600 BC, the Maya were the dominant people in the region.
 Between 300 BC and 150 BC, Mayan villages grew into larger and more populous cities, ruled by powerful kings and noble families. It was during this so-called Pre-Classic
 period that Maya society defined its cultural identity. 
^    It was also during this time that the Maya began to worship a pantheon of gods, from the creator of the universe, [Huabku], to [Itzamna] (creator of man); from [Ix
 Chel] (goddess of childbirth), to [Chac] (the rainmaker – an all-important god to the peasant class); from [Yam Kax] (the young corn god), to [Ah Much] (the lord of death). As more and more gods were added to the pantheon, the rituals needed to glorify them
 became quite elaborate, and thus it was necessary to create a priest sect to maintain the ceremonies. 
^    One of the most important cultural traits developed during the [Pre-Classic] period was the act of human sacrifice. Though the Maya never practiced it as prominently as the Aztecs, various acts of blood letting became commonplace and (ultimately) essential to the Mayan way-of-life. Mayan kings ruled through semi-divine right, and they believed that their connection to the gods could only be maintained through ritual sacrifice.
#DESC_RACE_MAYANS
^
^Thus, temples (in the stair-step design) were constructed with sacrificial altars. On these altars were laid human offerings. Stone knives were produced and the bodies cut to let the blood flow. Then, with speed and determination, the chests were cut open and hearts ripped out. It was these ritual offerings that allowed Mayan kings and priests to hold absolute control over their subjects. 
^    By 300 AD, the Mayan Classic period was in full bloom. This was the age of kings.
 Great rulers such as {Smoke-Jaguar} (or Smoke-Imix), Pacal, Eighteen Rabbits, and Blue-Quetzal Macaw, rose to prominence and ruled brilliantly over their lands. Mayan society was divided into city-states, each with its own king and cultural center. During the Classic period, the political influence of various cities rose and fell:
 Chichen Itza, Palenque, Copan, and Tikal, to name a few. It was also during the Classic period that the Mayan military grew in organization and in strength. The Mayan soldier carried knives and spears, clubs, bows and arrows, {javelins}, and even perfected the art of throwing hornets nests (called [hornet bombs]) into enemy troops to create confusion and panic. For defense, they used small shields made of jaguar
 skins. And Mayan generals called upon their priests to [divine] the gods and determine the best place and time to attack the enemy. It was through warfare that the Mayans collected slaves to sacrifice to their gods.
^    By 850-900 AD, Mayan culture began a decline that saw its ultimate dissolution. One city after another began to fade away into the jungle in this Post-Classic period,
 as the populations vanished. Where did the Maya go? There is no consensus on this matter, but there are many theories. Environmental evidence suggests that a massive drought (hastened by volcanic activity), lasting for decades, hit the Yucatan Peninsula
 around this time. Another theory suggests that the peasantry, dissatisfied with their rulers, revolted. Another suggests disease savaged the populations and destabilized the local economies. Whatever the reason, by 1100 AD, the last of the great Mayan cities
 were swallowed by the jungle, and there they lay fallow for centuries until wealth-seeking Conquistadors and archeologists unearthed their wondrous remains and
 reintroduced the Mayan culture to the world.

^In 1139 CE, Afonse Henriques, appointed count of the province of Portugal by the king of Castile, defeated a
Muslim army at Ourique. Impolitely, he took that opportunity to declare Portugal independent of Castile, with
himself as king of the new country. He was able to get away with it largely due to the recognition by the
Christian kingdoms of Spain that the Muslims were the common enemy, and when assured that Portugal would still play
an active role in the impending Reconquista, Castile-Navarre and Aragon were willing to overlook Henriques’
impudence. Two hundred years later, once the Muslims were confined to their tiny corner of Spain in Granada,
Castile saw fit to repossess the Portuguese kingdom. When the Castilian army was soundly thrashed in battle by
the warrior king John of Aviz, it was clear to all that Portugal was there to stay.
^    After the victory over Castile and the collective reconquest of Iberia from the Muslims, Portugal looked
overseas to continue its expansion. King John led a campaign against Ceuta in North Africa (modern-day Morocco).
The ease of Ceuta’s conquest caught the attention of his third son, {Prince Henry the Navigator}. Henry’s
older brother Duarte succeeded to the throne after John’s death, and the two were often at odds, with Duarte
skeptical and suspicious of Henry’s ambitions to explore new lands and convert the natives to Christianity. For
the next twenty years Henry sponsored expeditions to western Africa, and even led a campaign to invade Tangiers
in 1437 (which ended in defeat). But on the whole Henry’s personal seafaring experience was limited; his
sobriquet comes from his patronage of other adventurers and the resulting age of discovery and colonization that
they inaugurated with his support.
^    Portuguese explorers continued their discoveries after Henry’s death in 1460. The greatest was Bartolomeu
Dias, whose 1488 voyage around the southern coast of Africa made Europe aware of the Indian Ocean and a shorter
route to India than the one Columbus gambled on just four years later. Dias also traveled across the western
Atlantic to Brazil; on that voyage he was lost at sea in 1498. 
^    Closely following Dias was Vasco da Gama, who took Dias’ maps
#DESC_RACE_PORTUGAL
^and went beyond their limits, landing in India in 1497. He made three trips to India over the following thirty
years, the last of which took place in 1524 after his appointment by the King as viceroy of India. He did not
live long after his arrival; some speculate he was poisoned by corrupt administrators who feared punishment at
his hands.
^    In 1543, Portuguese sailors were shipwrecked in Japan. They did not stay long, but left behind the technique
of musket-making –- in that way, a handful of men changed Japanese history forever, as the samurai era was drowned
by the sound of musketfire. By that time Portugal’s overseas holdings were vast, comprising holdings all over
Africa, India, China, Macao, and South America.
^    In 1580 Spain awoke, flexing its muscles as the world’s pre-eminent power. It took the opportunity to
occupy Portugal, and for almost 100 years the two countries were united. The Portuguese royalty did not give
up, though, and through clever diplomacy and alliance with England they were able to restore their monarchy and,
with Spain greatly weakened and demoralized by the Thirty Years’ War, finally forced Spanish recognition of
Portuguese independence. Portugal remained an influential and wealthy European power through the Napoleonic Wars,
when its alliance with Britain gave the British a foothold on the Continent to oppose Napoleon’s armies.
^    Portugal’s prosperity lasted until the 1890s, when a combination of inflation and sluggish
industrialization undermined its industries. Dissatisfaction with the monarchy led to a coup and the establishment
of a republic in 1910; this did not last long, as radical groups pursued extreme agendas and unrest grew. In 1926,
the army bloodlessly overthrew the republic; the junta asked a university professor and occasional member
of parliament named Antonio Oliviera de Salazar to assume control of all economic policy. Six years later,
Salazar became prime minister, a limited office in theory but dictator in practice. Salazar’s new
constitution formalized his powers and he ruled Portugal with absolute authority for nearly 40 years.
^    In 1968 Salazar suffered a stroke; his ministers tried to continue the dictatorship but in 1974 a
democratic revolution re-installed a republican form of government. After narrowly avoiding a Communist coup,
Portugal flourished, although it presently faces structural problems similar to those of its nearest
European neighbors.

^Toward the end of the 16th century CE, the independent cities and principalities of Flanders and Belgium sent
representatives to Utrecht to form an alliance. The alliance would coordinate taxation and military operations
against Spain, whose ruling Hapsburgs had dominion over the Low Countries even after they adopted the Protestant
religion. The Netherlands, comparatively small and poor compared to mighty Spain and its empire of gold in
the Americas, often had to rely on {Swiss mercenaries} and other hired guns for its defense. This was not a
long-term solution, hence the need for a much closer alliance. The result of this meeting was the Union of
Utrecht, which formally created the United Provinces of the Netherlands.
^    Spain, which had spent the previous decade alternately fighting and politicking against the armies and
intrigues of {William of Orange}, was not pleased by this development. Orange’s position had always been that
Spain’s sovereignty over the Netherlands was legitimate, but the governors chosen by the King were trampling
the rights of Orange and the other native nobles. William also vehemently opposed the imposition of Catholicism
on his homeland, but still felt the King of Spain could be persuaded to loosen his grip. This proved unrealistic,
and in 1581 Orange publicly renounced his loyalty to the Spanish throne. He was assassinated a few years later;
he did not live to see his country completely free of Spanish domination.
^    However, once the provincial leaders (particularly those of Holland, the largest and most influential of
the United Provinces) and the nobles began to cooperate, putting their disagreements to one side, Spain was
nearly defeated. Under the brilliant political, military, and economic leadership of Johan de Witt, perhaps
the Netherlands’ greatest statesman, the Dutch Republic grew into a world power, its rapidly growing economy and
naval presence allowing it to settle colonies around the world and establish a massive trade empire. This
wealth translated into a cultural golden age lasting over a hundred years.
^    During that time, Dutch thinkers made fundamental contributions to philosophy, law, science, and art.
Hugo Grotius, a lawyer and
#DESC_RACE_DUTCH
^philosopher, wrote “On the Law of War and Peace” in 1625 –- perhaps the first comprehensive analysis of
international law. The philosopher Baruch Spinoza published substantial revisions of his mentor Rene
Descartes’ rationalist works, and also wrote a lengthy defense of freedom of conscience –- which was promptly
denounced as heresy by his contemporaries. In art, an obscure portrait painter named Rembrandt van Rijn rose
to prominence (and disapproval) for his religious paintings and figure studies. Peter Paul Rubens, a great painter
in his own right, also ran an immense school for artists, attracting dozens of talented painters from all over
Europe to the Netherlands. The mathematician Christiaan Huygens developed his wave theory of light, which was a
giant leap in the study of optics pioneered by Isaac Newton. And biology was made incomparably easier by Antonie
van Leeuwenhoek’s invention of the microscope.
^    After the Golden Age, the Netherlands retreated into the background, as the English fleet gradually achieved
its supremacy. By the Napoleonic era, the Netherlands was once again dominated by its neighbors. In 1830,
Belgium broke away from the United Provinces, in reaction to the restoration of the monarchy and the subordination
of the Estates General, the council of stadtholders (provincial rulers). The Industrial Revolution came to
the Netherlands as it did to the rest of continental Europe, and when World War I arrived, the Dutch remained
neutral.
^    The Dutch were not so fortunate during World War II, as Hitler’s armies invaded and imposed their brutish
rule. (The diary of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl living in Amsterdam, is considered a classic portrait of innocence
confronted with great evil.) Despite an unusually active and vigorous resistance to the Nazis –- which was often
met with brutal reprisals –- a great many Dutch Jews died in the Nazi death camps. After the war, the former
Dutch colonies followed the pattern of other European colonies at the time, with independence and nationalist
movements breaking out everywhere. Dutch politics were still characterized by religious divisions even until
the 1970s, appropriately given the nation’s history, but a more conventional parliamentary party system arose.
Today the Netherlands, a thoroughly modern European nation, is best known for its hosting of international
institutions such as the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
