Armies
^
^
^An Army is actually a group of ordinary units that move and fight together. To form an army, you must build the Army unit
and then 'load' other units into it. You can load up to three units, though the $LINK<Pentagon=BLDG_Pentagon>
increases this limit to four, if you have built it.

^{Building an Army}
^Armies can be built in cities that have the $LINK<Military Academy=BLDG_Military_Academy>
or a $LINK<Leader=GCON_Leaders> in them. But you must have at least four cities for every army you create.
^
^{In Battle}
^An army uses one, some, or all its internal units to fight a battle, depending upon the course of the fight.
^
^{Spotting}
^An army can "see" up to two squares away, due to its intrinsic scouts.
