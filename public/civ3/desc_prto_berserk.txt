^In the pagan era, before Scandinavia was converted to Christianity, the berserkir warriors were looked upon as 
possessing supernatural powers attributed to the Viking's chief god, Odin and a belief in lycanthropy.  These 
warriors were known to rush into battle without armor, as mad as wolves, and as strong as wild boars.  This 
infamous berserkir frenzy reportedly allowed them to kill men in single blows with great bearded axes and shrug 
off blows from fire and iron alike.  Today it is believed that these frenzies were the result of epileptic 
attacks.
