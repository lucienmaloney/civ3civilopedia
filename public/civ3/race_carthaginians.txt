^Carthaginians were 8th century BC Phoenician emigrants who fled from the Persian-held city of Tyre and sought to fashion 
their own identity in the fertile peninsula of northern Africa.  The effort of these refugees was realized in the foundation 
of Carthage.  The Romans knew the people of Carthage as "Poeni", a derivation of the word "Phoenicians", from which the 
adjective "Punic" is also derived.  Carthage is located in modern-day Tunisia, bordered by Algeria, Libya, and the 
Mediterranean Sea.  Located roughly center of the triangular Cap Bon peninsula, it is surrounded by low hills and backed 
by the lake of Tunis, allowing for safe anchorage and an abundant supply of fish.  The resulting city site was well 
protected, and easily defensible.  Carthaginian control extended as far southwest as Theveste in northern Algeria; 
throughout which, a thriving agriculture developed.
^    The actual stages of growth in Carthaginian power are unknown, but the process was largely complete by the start of 
the 4th century BC.  Ancient sources indicate that Carthage had perhaps become the richest city in the world via trade in 
perishable goods such as textiles, un-worked metals, food, and slaves.  Tin, silver, gold, and iron were obtained in 
exchange for these manufactured and consumer goods.  Carthage maintained a monopoly of trade from the 6th to 3rd century 
BC by sinking all intruders and exacting recognition of its position from neighboring Mediterranean states.  This wealth 
was attested by the vast mercenary armies it was able to maintain with a mintage of gold coins far exceeding that known 
for any other advanced state of its time. 
^    While frequently led by Carthaginian soldiers, the majority of the Carthaginian armies was comprised of mercenaries.  
Celts and Iberians contributed large numbers of infantry and horsemen, but {Numidian Infantry} dominated their ranks.  These 
Numidian mercenaries were equipped with loot from assorted engagements against Rome, and were generally regarded as capable 
soldiers and spearmen.
^    The First Punic War between Rome and Carthage resulted from attempts to garner control over lands and trade routes 
through Corsica and Sicily.  Carthaginians intervened in a dispute between the
