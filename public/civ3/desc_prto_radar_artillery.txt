^Modern radar has had two major impacts on field artillery. The first is that it can accurately "trace" fire from enemy
artillery back to their firing location. The second is to better aim their own artillery to return fire more quickly
and accurately. While increasing the technical sophistication of indirect fire weapons (including the support personnel
required to maintain such high tech devices), it has also increased their flexibility. Radar has enabled the precise 
targeting of enemies at any time of day, in any weather condition.
