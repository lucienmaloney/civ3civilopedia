#DESC_PRTO_Javelin_Thrower

^The Mayan army was comprised of warriors armed with a variety of weapons: lances, clubs, daggers, and even tridents. When the Aztecs introduced them to the [atl-atl] (a tool used to extend the throwing range and penetration strength of a javelin) in the 9th century, the javelin thrower became a staple in the Mayan warrior class. Capable of launching spears in rapid succession, the javelin thrower is a powerful force on the battlefield. 
^
^The primary purpose of war for the Mayans was not to kill the enemy, but to enslave him. In particular, the capture of the enemy�s leader. He and his direct subordinates were carried triumphantly to the captors� city, where they were summarily sacrificed to the gods. The rest of the vanquished army was enslaved. Therefore, the Javelin Thrower has the ability to "enslave".
