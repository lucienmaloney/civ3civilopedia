^Cavalry is composed of soldiers trained to fight on horseback. Because of their speed, cavalry units were often 
used for reconnaissance missions and hit-and-run raids on enemy installations and troops. Although warriors 
fighting from horseback with a variety of weapons date back to ancient Egypt, horse-mounted cavalry as we 
generally think of it today actually began in the late 1700s. Under Napoleon, the cavalry became an elite 
force, frequently deployed simultaneously with foot soldiers to mask the movements of the main battle force. 
Cavalry were used extensively in the American Civil War, and in other conflicts throughout the mid to late 
19th century. When the repeating rifle replaced earlier single-shot firearms, horse-mounted troops became 
easy targets for infantrymen. The South African War, from 1899 to 1902, was the last major conflict where 
cavalry played an important role. Today, the roles once performed by horse-mounted cavalry have been assumed by 
troops utilizing armored assault vehicles and aircraft.
