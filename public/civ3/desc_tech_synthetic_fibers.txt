^Modern advances in chemical engineering have given us many new substances which have an astounding number of applications. 
One of the great advances in the chemistry field was the creation of synthetic fibers. Fibers such as polyester, nylon, and 
rayon are all laboratory-made and have all been found to have amazing uses - everything from clothing to parachutes. 
Some non-fabric applications, such as seat belts and Kevlar vests, have helped to save lives. New uses for these amazing 
substances are still being developed, and our world is becoming more indebted to the development of synthetic fibers.
