^The Zulu are a tribe of Nguni-speaking people centered in what is now the Natal province of South Africa. 
They are a branch of the southern Bantu and have close ethnic, linguistic and cultural ties with the Swazi 
and Xhosa. Before they overwhelmed the neighboring tribes under their leader {Shaka} in the early 19th century 
to form an empire, the Zulu were only one of the many patrilineal Nguni clans in the Mtetwa empire. Traditionally 
grain farmers, the Zulu also kept large herds of cattle on the lightly wooded grasslands, replenishing their herds 
by raiding neighboring tribes. Boys in Shaka's militaristic society were initiated at adolescence in groups called 
age sets. Each age set constituted a unit of the Zulu army and was stationed away from home at royal barracks under 
direct control of the King. Formed into regiments ({Impi}), these men could marry and leave service only when the 
king gave permission to the age set as a whole. 
^    On the death of the last Mtetwa emperor in 1817, Shaka (1816-28) established his clan's dominance over their 
neighbors and, using a well-disciplined and efficient fighting force, conquered most of the Natal region. During 
the reign of Shaka's successor, Dingane, Boer settlers, who formed an alliance with Dingane's brother and deposed 
him in 1840, penetrated the Zulu empire. The empires survived, but under King Mpande (1840-72) portions of Zulu 
territory were occupied by the Boers and by the British, who moved into Natal in 1838 and annexed it in 1843. 
War broke out in 1878 when Mpande's successor, Cetshwayo, refused to disband his Impi and to place himself under 
British control. Despite stiff resistance, the British defeated the poorly armed Zulu in July 1879, occupied the 
remainder of their country, and divided Zululand into 13 small kingdoms. Zululand was made a British crown colony 
in 1887 under the Native Law of Natal, and bloody Zulu rebellions were put down in 1888 and 1906. By British edict 
in 1894, two-thirds of the Zulu's remaining land was confiscated, and they were confined to native reserves. 
The incorporation of Zululand into Natal in 1897 ended its separate existence. Under the apartheid system, a Bantu 
Homeland (later called a "black state") named KwaZulu was established for the Zulu in the 1970s and was composed
