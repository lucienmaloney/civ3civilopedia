^Although humankind has mastered space flight, the concept of interstellar and deep space travel presents many new problems 
to engineers and physicists. The Exterior Casing of the Space Ship is itself a technological marvel. Designed around a 
composite system of layered ceramic, zero-gee manufactured aluminum-titanium alloy, and high density polymers, the Exterior 
Casing is made to withstand both the dangers of debris within star systems and of radiation throughout its travel. Built 
into the Exterior Casing is also a complex web of electric wiring, capable of carrying a very high positive or negative 
electromagnetic charge, providing a shield from radiation and literally funneling electromagnetic energy and space borne 
hydrogen dust into the solar sail where it can be collected and used for further fuel. It is also designed with multiple 
levels of sensors designed to collect scientific data and to give a clear picture to the navigational computer and to the 
pilots of what is going on outside of the vehicle. Although this composite design for an Exterior Casing is expensive, the 
protection and potential scientific information that it affords is well worth the cost of manufacture.
