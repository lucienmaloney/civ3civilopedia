Short Game Modes
^{Regicide}
^Regicide is a victory condition, in which each player has a "King" unit. This unit represents the 
civilization's Great Leader (for the Americans, the 'King' unit is Abraham Lincoln). When the Regicide victory 
condition is enabled, if the "King" unit is killed, the controlling player is eliminated from the game. Once 
the "King" has been eliminated, all units, colonies, airbases, and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, 
becoming ruins until something new is built on it. The Regicide victory condition can be enabled on the Player 
Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.
^
^{Mass Regicide}
^Mass Regicide is a victory condition, in which each player has several "King" units. These units represent 
the civilization's Great Leader (for the Americans, the "King" unit is Abraham Lincoln). When the Mass Regicide 
victory condition is enabled, if all of a player's "King" units are killed, the controlling player is eliminated 
from the game. Once the "Kings" have been eliminated, all units, colonies, airbases, and cities belonging to 
that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built in that location. The Mass Regicide 
victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in the Editor.
^
^{Elimination}
^Elimination is a victory condition. When this victory condition is enabled, any civilization that loses a 
city to an enemy is eliminated from the game. Once a player has been eliminated, all units, colonies, airbases, 
and cities belonging to that player are destroyed, becoming ruins until something new is built in that location.  
The Elimination victory condition can be enabled on the Player Setup Screen, the Multiplayer Setup Screen, and in
the Editor.

^{Wonder Victory}
^This is a new method of suddenly bringing a game to conclusion. If this condition is enabled the game ends as
soon as [all] Great Wonders have been built. The winner is then determined based on victory points -- not
necessarily on building the greatest number of wonders, nor a specific wonder.
