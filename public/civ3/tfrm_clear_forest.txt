#TFRM_Clear_Forest
^
^
^A worker can clear the $LINK<forest=TERR_Forest> from a square and contribute 10 $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields> to the nearest controlled city.
The resulting terrain will be either $LINK<grasslands=TERR_Grassland>, $LINK<plains=TERR_Plains>, or $LINK<tundra=TERR_Tundra>, depending upon the base terrain beneath the forest.
^
^A worker is ordered to clear forests by pressing [Shift-C] or the "Clear Forest" button in a forest square.
