^The founding of Rome on the fertile Tibur River is obscured by myth and legend, but it is generally accepted that 
Rome was first settled in 753 BC and that the Republic was founded in 509 BC, following the overthrow of Lucius 
Tarquinius Superbus, the last of Rome's seven kings. Rome was built on a site highly prized by the Etruscans, who 
dominated the Italian peninsula in the 6th century BC. The Etruscan king Porsenna defeated the Romans and expelled 
Tarquinius Superbus. Yet before Porsenna could establish himself as monarch over the unruly Romans, he was forced 
to withdraw. Rather than restoring their inept king, the citizens replaced the monarchy with two elected consuls, 
generals whose primary task it was to lead Rome's armies, and a Senate to serve as an advisory body. Where the 
Etruscans had failed, the people of Rome succeeded in the task of unifying the various Italian peoples into a 
political whole.
^    Toward the end of the 5th century BC, the Romans, propelled by the pressures of unchecked population growth, 
began to expand at the expense of nearby city-states. Rome's first two wars were fought with Fidenae, an independent 
city near Rome, and against Veii, an important Etruscan city. In the process, the expanding Roman Republic found the 
Greek phalanx formation too unwieldy for fragmented fighting in the hills and valleys of central Italy; accordingly, 
Rome evolved a new tactical system based on flexible ranks of cohorts, organized into self-contained {Legions}, the 
means by which Imperial Rome conquered and ruled the ancient world.
^    When Rome became increasingly powerful, the remaining city-states took up arms; the ensuing Latin War (340-338 BC) 
was quickly decided in Rome's favor. By 264 BC all Italy south of the Alps was united under the leadership of Rome, 
its members either incorporated in or allied with the Republic. Rome's growing influence led it into conflict with 
Carthage, an established commercial power in northern Africa. The defeat and destruction of Carthage in the three 
Punic Wars (264-146 BC) sustained Rome's acquisitive momentum, and the Republic set its sights on dominating the 
entire Mediterranean area. In short order, the
