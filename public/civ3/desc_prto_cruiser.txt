^Cruisers have long served in the role of escort and defensive vessels, screening carrier task forces and 
amphibious assaults from enemy ships and aircraft. During WWII cruisers were classified as light ("CL") or
heavy ("CA"). Light cruisers typically had guns no larger than 6" in diameter, whereas heavy cruisers had
guns larger than 6" but smaller than 8". Unlike most cruisers fielded by the Allies, Japanese cruisers also
sported deadly banks of "Long Lance" oxygen-fueled torpedoes. Furthermore, Japanese cruisers carried
reloads for their deadly torpedoes (torpedoes were one-shot deals for other navies).
