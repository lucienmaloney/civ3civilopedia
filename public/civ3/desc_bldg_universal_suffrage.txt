^After decades of struggle, women in the United States won the right to vote in 1920 with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. The achievement of women's suffrage was accelerated by the excellent record of women working in jobs traditionally held by men 
during World War I. Full voting rights were granted to women in Great Britain in 1928. Since that time, women have gained the right to vote in most 
countries in the developed world.
