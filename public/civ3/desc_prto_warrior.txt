^The earliest military forces were simply the citizens of the city, armed with whatever implements they could 
use as weapons. Although a militia made up of warriors was inexpensive, they were no match for organized 
armies. Warriors were usually used as stopgap measures while waiting for superior units to be trained, or to 
defend a city that had been temporarily cut off from military support. In a crisis situation, an assembly of 
warriors is better than no defense at all.
