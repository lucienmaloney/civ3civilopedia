^A major obstacle to population growth and expansion in early cities was the scarcity of water. In many cases, the solution to this problem 
was an aqueduct. Aqueducts were large, elevated stone "canals" through which water from nearby hills and mountains was channeled into the 
city. Aqueducts allowed cities to grow much larger by significantly increasing the amount of available water. At the same time aqueducts 
reduced the chance of contracting water-borne diseases, by reducing the dependence on stagnant ponds and wells as water sources. Aqueducts 
also allowed cities to be built in normally inhospitable environments, such as deserts, by providing an outside water source. Modern day Los 
Angeles, for example, obtains its water supply from the Colorado River, through a system of aqueducts over 200 miles long.
