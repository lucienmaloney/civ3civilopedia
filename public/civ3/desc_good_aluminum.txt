^A silvery, gray metal, aluminum has a staggering number of uses and applications. Just a few examples include the fact it never 
rusts, is lighter than copper (and almost as effective in electricity transmission), and is soft enough to easily mold for nearly any 
purpose. Though the dominant metal in the Earth�s composition, aluminum wasn�t discovered until 1825, thousands of years 
after copper and iron. The primary reason for this was the difficulty in extracting the metal from the ore (in modern aluminum, 
the ore bauxite). Charles Hall, a 22-year-old American, created what was to become the most cost effective method of 
separating aluminum in 1886. His process involved passing an electrical current through aluminum oxide, resulting in two 
separate components of pure aluminum and oxygen.
