#TFRM_Build_Colony
^
^
^A worker can establish a colony on any square that contains a $LINK<tradable resource=GCON_ResourcesN>.
If the colony is then $LINK<connected=GCON_Trade> to a city, that city gains access to the resource. A colony
is necessary only if the resource is not inside your $LINK<borders=GCON_Territory>. Note that when a city's
borders expand to include a colony, the colony disappears because it is no longer needed. The worker is consumed
by building a colony.
^
^A worker is ordered to build a colony by pressing [B] or the "Build Colony" button.
