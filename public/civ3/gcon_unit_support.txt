#GCON_Unit_Support
Supporting Military Units
^
^
^Generally, each military unit must be supported with one gold per turn from its $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>.
However, each form of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> defers these costs for a certain number of units,
depending upon how many towns, cities, or metros the civilization controls.
