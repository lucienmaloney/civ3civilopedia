^with their slashing and stabbing sword, but also with a helmet and shield.  They often charged into battle 
bare-chested or completely naked, occasionally wearing vividly patterned pants or cloaks.  Similar to the 
Viking Berserker, they began their battles by viciously taunting their enemies, and followed it with a mad 
rush against enemy lines.  This was standard behavior for skirmishes between clans, which were frequent in 
Celtic society.  These tribal conflicts provided starting points for young Celts who sought to openly display 
their bravery and skill as a warrior.  Celtic warriors were also known to serve as mercenaries to numerous 
armies of the classical period.  The best known of instance of this, is when Celtic mercenaries joined Hannibal 
in his invasion of Italy during the 2nd Punic War, contributing to victories against Rome.
^    The Celts' previous capture and sack of Rome, headed by {Brennus}, also remained an indelible mark on Roman 
folk memory, and was likely the instigator for Rome's merciless treatment of the Celts in subsequent wars.  
This mutual hostility did not cease until the Gauls and Britons were later formally incorporated into the Roman 
Empire.
^    Despite the writings and other information that paints the Celts as uncultured savages, the relatively 
sophisticated weapons, pottery, jewelry, and other equipment found at burial sites serves to remind us that 
they were very far from being the savages they were once depicted as.  On the contrary, it in fact 
appears that the Celts maintained a rich culture that is survived by the modern Celtic and Gallic speakers of 
Ireland, Highland Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales and Brittany.
