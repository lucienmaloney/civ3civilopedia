^Carthage maintained a monopoly of trade from the 6th to 3rd century BC by sinking all intruders and exacting 
recognition of its position from neighboring Mediterranean states.  This wealth was attested by the vast 
mercenary armies it was able to maintain with a mintage of gold coins far exceeding that known for any other 
advanced state of its time. While frequently led by Carthaginian soldiers, the majority of the Carthaginian 
armies was comprised of mercenaries.  Celts and Iberians contributed large numbers of infantry and horsemen, but 
Numidian Infantry dominated their ranks.  These Numidian mercenaries were equipped with loot from assorted 
engagements against Rome, and were generally regarded as capable soldiers and spearmen.
