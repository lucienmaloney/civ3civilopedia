^Many of the services performed by banks today can be traced back to medieval Europe. Certain families, such as the Medicis of Italy, were 
known for the banking duties they performed. These wealthy merchants pooled their surplus money into a bank, then loaned cash (with 
interest) to other commercial enterprises. The availability of this capital for investment made many new businesses possible, accelerating 
economic growth. The first modern banks were established in Europe during the late 1600s. The primary function of today's banking system 
is the granting of loans to consumers and businesses. In addition to loaning money and safeguarding deposits, banks also invest in government 
and private securities and bonds. Both the loan and investment functions of banks not only make profits for the bank itself, but also stimulate 
the economy by providing funds for business growth and consumer purchases.
