^The contrivance of a previously unknown device, method, or process, which can, in turn, be used to accomplish an objective in a way 
thought to be impossible, is known as invention. Essentially, inventiveness is the ability to take one or more newly discovered concepts and 
find a way to put them to practical use. The earliest inventions of mankind date back to ancient stone and metal tools used for hunting, 
digging, and other everyday tasks. After writing allowed the ideas of various civilizations to be exchanged and studied, mankind's inventions 
became increasingly more useful and innovative. Most inventions are geared toward improving or simplifying human existence in some way. 
Often, inventions themselves make it possible to make new discoveries, which then go on to inspire better and more innovative inventions.
