^Built entirely in space and for space travel, the Space Ship is a marvel of human technology. The Docking Bay module 
allows for the transfer of personnel and materials both during the initial loading of the Space Ship as well as during its 
final orbit, during which it will be converted to a Space Station for the first phase of the colonization and terraforming 
process. The Docking Bay module also holds the RCV Manned Shuttle, the main travel and transit vehicle for the Space Ship 
occupants, as well as providing access for the engineers to the exterior of the Space Ship during space walks. The Docking 
Bay is in essence a large air lock with a door large enough to release the RCV, flanked by a pair of smaller air locks for 
transferal of small teams of individuals. The Docking Bay also has large magnetic locks, allowing the Space Ship to join to 
the International Space Station prior to its departure during the final phases of supply loading before launching from 
Earth's orbit for its interstellar trip.
