^The development of writing meant that the accumulated knowledge of a society could be written down and stored rather than memorized 
and passed along by word of mouth. The accumulated written material was stored in a library. The libraries of the ancient world, 
especially those at Alexandria and Pergamum, became leading centers of science and scholarship. The librarians actively collected 
the books of the world, accelerating the spread of knowledge.
