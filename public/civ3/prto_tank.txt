^
^[Tanks] are fast-moving offensive units that can [attack multiple times] in a single turn and [withdraw]
from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit, of course).

^A city must have both $LINK<oil=GOOD_Oil> and $LINK<rubber=GOOD_Rubber> in its
$LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build tanks.
