^Before the establishment of centralized governments capable of supporting strong, national armies, individual cities were left to fend for 
themselves when it came to defense. As a result, many cities constructed city walls to protect against raiders and bandits. City walls

integrity. However, these walls turned the city into a fortress capable of withstanding all but the most determined attack.
