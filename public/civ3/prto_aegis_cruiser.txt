#PRTO_AEGIS_Cruiser
^
^
^[AEGIS Cruisers] are nimble and lethal. They can bombard up to two squares away; they have [radar] so they can see two squares
regardless of blocking terrain; and they can see $LINK<submarines=PRTO_Submarine> when within their radar range.
All in all the AEGIS Cruiser is a formidable warship.

^A coastal city needs $LINK<aluminum=GOOD_Aluminum> and $LINK<uranium=GOOD_Uranium> in its
$LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build an AEGIS Cruiser.
