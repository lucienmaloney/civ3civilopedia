^During World War II and in the years that followed, great leaps were made in the field of aviation. The military
demands of the war necessitated the development of aircraft designed for long-range bombing, and for the transportation
of troops and equipment. Although advances in aviation were made all over the world during this time, the Germans were
particularly adept in the development of advanced flight technologies. In 1944, they developed the V-2, the first truly
guided missile, capable of delivering 2000 pounds of explosives to targets nearly 200 miles away. The Germans also
developed the Me 262, the first jet fighter plane, which was first used in 1945. Although both the V-2 and the Me 262
came too late to affect the outcome of World War II, both of these advances paved the way for the advanced flight
technologies of today.
