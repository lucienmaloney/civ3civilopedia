^In the 1st century BC, Strabo wrote of the Celts: 'The whole race... is madly fond of war, high-spirited and 
quick to battle... and on whatever pretext you stir them up, you will have them ready to face danger, even if they 
have nothing on their side but their own strength and courage'.  Much of what we know about Celtic culture today 
has been derived from the insights of the various writers and geographers of the time; coupled with finds from 
Celtic burial sights located in Bavaria, Bohemia, and Upper Austria.  The Celts once formed a loose-knit 
'empire', inhabiting territory that stretched in a chaotic band across central Europe.  The writings and 
findings of modern archeologists place Celtic civilization as ranging from the Atlantic Coast of the British

^    At the age of fourteen, Celtic boys attained manhood and were permitted to bear arms, while girls became 
eligible for marriage.  Young nobles and sons of freemen who reached their fourteenth birthday became clients 
of a famous lord or well-reputed Celtic Knight.  Such warrior retinues were called 'Fianna'.  These junior 
warriors sought out and followed experienced warriors whose success could provide them with greater chances 
at their own wealth and glory.
^    While the bulk of a Celtic army would typically consist of poorly armored spearmen, it was the warrior 
nobles who wielded swords that were the most feared.  These {Gallic Swordsmen} were wealthier than their peers, 
and could afford to equip themselves not only
