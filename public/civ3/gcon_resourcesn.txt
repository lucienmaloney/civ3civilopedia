Natural Resources
^
^
^There are 27 [natural resources] represented by various icons scattered around the world. These fall into three
categories, [Bonus, Luxury,] and [Strategic].
^
^
^[$LINK<Bonus Resources=GCON_ResourcesB>] give city production bonuses in worked squares within a city radius. Bonus resources
cannot be traded to other cities or civilizations. Bonus resources are always visible in $LINK<explored=GCON_Maps> areas of the map. 
^
^
^[$LINK<Luxury Resources=GCON_ResourcesL>] also give city production bonuses in squares worked by citizens.
But they may also be traded along trade routes, and make content people happy in cities that receive them. Luxury
resources are always visible on the map in explored areas.
^
^
^[$LINK<Strategic Resources=GCON_ResourcesS>], like both the others, give bonuses to city production, but, like luxuries they can also be traded.
Strategic resources are required for a city to build various military units and city improvements. Strategic resources 
appear on the map when a Civilization Advance exposes their usefulness.
^
^
^Luxury and Strategic Resources are referred to as {Tradable Resources.}
