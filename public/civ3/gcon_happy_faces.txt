Happy Faces
^
^
^City improvements, wonders, entertainers, and luxuries produce either [content] or [happy faces] in the
city where they exist. 
^
^{These								Produce this}
^* City improvements						content faces
^* Wonders								content faces
^* Military police							content faces
^* Luxuries								happy faces
^* Entertainers							happy faces
^* Entertainment							happy faces
^
^Each happy face affects the $LINK<mood=GCON_Moods> of one citizen.
^* Each [content face] makes one unhappy citizen content.
^* Each [happy face] makes one content citizen happy.
^
^If there aren't enough faces of the appropriate sort in a city, extra faces will have a limited "carry over" effect. For example, if a city has the capability to generate 5 happy faces, yet there are only 2 content faces in the city, then those 2 content faces will become happy and the remaining 3 happy faces will carry over to unhappy citizens at reduced efficiency.
^
^Certain political events, such as winning or losing battles and wars, can also influence the overall happiness in your civilization's cities.
