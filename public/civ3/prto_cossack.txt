#PRTO_Cossack
^
^
^The Russian special unit, [Cossacks] take the place of $LINK<cavalry=PRTO_Cavalry>. The [Cossack] is a fast moving unit that can [attack multiple times] in a single turn and will [withdraw] from combat if losing the fight (unless fighting another fast unit, of course).
^
^A Russian city must have both $LINK<horses=GOOD_Horses> and $LINK<saltpeter=GOOD_Saltpeter> in its
$LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build cossacks.
