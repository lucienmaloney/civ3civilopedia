^Few composers were more prolific or beloved than Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach, the most well known member of a gifted family of German 
musicians, was perhaps the finest composer of the baroque style of music. In his time, he wrote numerous choral and orchestral pieces. During his 
lifetime, he was renowned as an organist and music director of St. Thomas' Church in Leipzig, and many of his compositions were religious in nature. 
After his death, Bach's music gained worldwide appreciation.
