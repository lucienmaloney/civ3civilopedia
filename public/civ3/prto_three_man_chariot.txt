#PRTO_Three_Man_Chariot
^
^
^[Hittite Three-Man Chariots] take the place of normal chariots. They move quickly and will [withdraw]
from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit). Like other chariot units, they are wheeled and
may not enter $LINK<mountain=TERR_Mountains>, $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano>, $LINK<jungle=TERR_Jungle> or
$LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh> terrain unless following a road.
^
^A city must have $LINK<horses=GOOD_Horses> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to
build a three-man chariot.
