#DESC_PRTO_Hoplite
^
^
^Hoplites were well-trained citizen-soldiers of ancient Greece. Armed with spears and durable armor, they
fulfilled the heavy infantry role in most engagements.
^
^Hoplites will always be associated with the phalanx unit formation. This tactic involved 
tightly packed groupings of eight or 16 rows of soldiers, who, against other citizen-soldiers, move and attack
in unison scattering less densely organized enemy forces. This tactic worked well, but broke down when facing
more mobile and well-trained professional soldiers. The Roman legions victory over the Macedonian phalanx at Pydna in 
168 BC effectively ended the Hoplite's battlefield usefulness.
