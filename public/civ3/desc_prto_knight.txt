^Knights were heavily armored, mounted men-at-arms found primarily in medieval Europe. Like the samurai of ancient Japan, 
knights followed a strict code that covered their behavior both in battle and in their personal pursuits. 
Fighting astride powerful horses, armored knights had a distinct advantage over enemies on foot and remained 
the dominant force on the battlefield when battles were fought primarily hand-to-hand. Occasionally, brilliant 
infantry tactics allowed knights to be outmaneuvered, but it wasn't until the development of gunpowder that knights 
were rendered obsolete.
