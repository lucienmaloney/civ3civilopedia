^The Kingdom of Spain is located in the extreme southwest of the European continent, and occupies approximately 85-percent 
of the Iberian Peninsula.  Spain is bordered on the west by Portugal, in the Northeast by France, and by the great wall of the 
Pyrenees Mountains.  The Iberian Peninsula that the Spanish inhabited was occupied by various other civilizations, including 
the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, and Muslims, and Spain is now associated with having a very rich, eclectic 
culture as a result.
^    The development of Christian society and culture in the first 300 years following Islamic conquest in Spain was slow, but 
major changes occurred for the Spanish in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The population grew, communication with northern 
Europe intensified, commerce and urban life gained in importance, and the kingdoms of the Castile, Aragon, and Navarre, and 
Portugal emerged as the governing bodies of the Iberian Peninsula.  These kingdoms reached the frontiers that they would keep, 
with minimum amount of alteration, until the end of the Middle Ages, when {Isabella I} became Queen of Castile.
^    Isabella began participating in the royal court at the age of 13; and when Portugal, Aragon, and France offered their 
marriage candidates, she favored Ferdinand of Aragon.  Isabella ascended to the throne as Queen of Castile to rule sensibly 
and with a prudent political program.  Her unification of the states of the Iberian Peninsula into a single entity, the 
maintenance and control over the Strait of Gibraltar, policy of expansion into Muslim North Africa, reform of Spanish 
Catholicism, and support for the exploration and expansion in the unknown was evidence of her wisdom and capabilities as 
Queen.
^    On October 12, 1492 Columbus, with the blessing and financial backing of Isabella, sought a route to the legendary rich 
markets of China and Japan, but instead discovered what would become known as "The New World", the present day Americas.  This 
voyage gave way to a new golden age of expeditions and conquest, as the Americas contained gold, a valuable resource that Spain 
happened to be desperately bereft of at the time.
