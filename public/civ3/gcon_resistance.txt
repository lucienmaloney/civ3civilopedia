Resistance
^
^
^[Resistance] represents the unwillingness of the citizens of a strong culture to be subjugated by
another, less valuable culture. When a city is captured, a comparison of the 
$LINK<civilization cultural values=GCON_Culture> of the two civilizations determines if any of the
$LINK<foreign nationals=GCON_Nationality> will resist.
^
^Resisters are unwilling to work under the new regime.
^ 
^{Stopping Resistance}
^Resisters can be quelled by ending the war or garrisoning strong military units in the city -- the more the better.
