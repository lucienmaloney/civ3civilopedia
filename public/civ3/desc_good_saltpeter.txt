^When found in nature, saltpeter (also known as potassium nitrate) takes the form of a white powdery substance. A major 
component in black gunpowder beginning around the 12th century, it has also contributed to the fields of medicine, food 
preservation and farming. The manufacturing of saltpeter is accomplished by combining the compounds sodium nitrate and 
potassium chloride.
