^[Stealth Bombers] can do everything normal bombers can do and more. They can execute all
$LINK<air missions=GCON_Air_Missions>, except air superiority. Due to their stealth technology, stealth bombers
are very difficult to intercept by enemy air superiority $LINK<fighters=PRTO_Jet_Fighter>, and/or
$LINK<SAM=BLDG_SAM_Missile_Battery> batteries.

^The Stealth Bomber has both Lethal Land and Sea Bombardment.

^A city must have $LINK<oil=GOOD_Oil> and $LINK<aluminum=GOOD_Aluminum> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS>
to build a stealth bomber.
