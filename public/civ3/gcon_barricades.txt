Barricades
^
^
^When a civilization has learned $LINK<construction=TECH_Construction>, its workers know how to construct
stone and masonry [barricades], which are even more formidable than $LINK<Fortresses=GCON_Fortresses>. 
^
^A Barricades can only be built on a square already containing a Fortress. Even if unoccupied, barricades
automatically stops movement of a ground unit entering its square (unless that unit belongs to the same civilization
currently controlling the barricade's square, or if that unit has a $LINK<Right of Passage=GCON_Agreements>
agreement through that land. Barricades become a fortress if their square is pillaged.
^
^Military units inside barricades have a few advantages.
^* They get a 100% defensive bonus if attacked (i.e., twice the defensive bonus being in a Fortress).
^* The $LINK<zone of control=GCON_ZOC> exerted by the fortress still applies to a barricades.
