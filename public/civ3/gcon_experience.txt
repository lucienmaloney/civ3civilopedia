#GCON_Experience
Combat Experience
^
^
^Military units are rated according to combat experience: [conscripts, regulars, veterans,] and [elite units].
The more experienced a unit, the more damage it can absorb before being destroyed in combat.
The number of blocks in the unit's health bar shows this distinction.
^
^{Unit Type		   Blocks}
^Conscripts				2
^Regulars				3
^Veterans				4
^Elite units				5
^
^
^Normally, cities produce regulars. But if a city has a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks>, it produces [veterans].
Occasionally your men will discover barbarian tribes that contribute [conscripts] to your army, and sometimes you
may institute the draft, which also produces conscripts.
^
^
^[Elite units] cannot be built: they gain this status only through actual combat experience. An elite unit can produce a
$LINK<great leader=GCON_Leaders>, if it continues to be successful.

^{Battlefield Promotions}
^When one of your units is victorious in battle, there is a chance it will gain combat experience and be promoted to
the next level.
