^The original colosseum provided entertainment for the common people of Roman society by presenting them with spectacles and events as a 
temporary escape from day-to-day life. This concept has been revived in the 20th Century. Modern-day stadiums and civic centers provide an 
arena for entertainment ranging from concerts to professional sporting events. Although the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat is a 
thing of the past, today's colosseums still provide entertainment and diversion for the masses.
