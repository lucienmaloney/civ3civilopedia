^
^You rule as a feudal king, dependent on your vassal lords for support and bound to respect their wishes. $LINK<Corruption=GCON_Corruption> among the lords is a continual problem.  In addition, your vassals are wary of continual warfare and $LINK<war weariness=GCON_War_Weariness> may result. You do not suffer the production problems associated with $LINK<despotism=GOVT_Despotism>, however.  Maintenance cost per unit per turn is 3 gold instead of 1.
