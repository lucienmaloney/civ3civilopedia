^One of the most effective weapons in modern military arsenals is the cruise missile. The AGM-86 and the Tomahawk can be launched against a strategic target hundreds of miles away, traveling low 
to avoid radar and other means of detection, and hitting their target with unnerving accuracy.  They can also 
be used against short-range, tactical targets such as ships. In this role, it is often possible for a single, 
one million dollar missile to seriously damage or even destroy 80 million dollar warships.
