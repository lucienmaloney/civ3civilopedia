^
^
^[Crusaders] are devout and dangerous medieval fighters with a mission. Crusaders also have a special ability
that allows them to also build fortresses.
^
^The $LINK<Knights Templar=BLDG_Knights_Templar> Great Wonder, unless rendered obsolete, automatically produces
a Crusader every five turns.
