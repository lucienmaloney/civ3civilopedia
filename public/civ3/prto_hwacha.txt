#PRTO_Hwacha
^
^The [Hwach'a] replaces the $LINK<cannon=PRTO_Cannon> as the siege weapon of choice for the $LINK<Korean=RACE_Koreans> 
civilization in the Middle Ages.  The [Hwach'a] is a more advanced artillery unit, capable of bombarding adjacent 
targets.  Hwach'a have no attack or defense value, so they should be protected by an escort.  Further, they 
are wheeled units, so they cannot enter $LINK<mountain=TERR_Mountains>, $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano>,
$LINK<jungle=TERR_Jungle> or $LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh> terrain unless following a road.
^
^
^The Hwach'a has both Lethal Sea and Land Bombardment.
^
^
^A city must have $LINK<saltpeter=GOOD_Saltpeter> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> to build a Hwach'a.
