^Theology is the study of God and religious truth. Theologians take a more or less scientific approach to questions of religion, deeply studying 
the underlying meaning of scriptures and religious teachings rather than "taking them on faith". Theological seminaries teach courses of study in 
theology to prepare people as priests and clergymen. Many of the earliest colleges of the western world were originally established for this 
purpose. Theological study helped to remove some of the superstitions that had surrounded religion for so long, and brought religious study 
into a more enlightened age.
