^Since ancient times, hunting of game animals has been important both for survival and for sport. Forested areas containing a large 
concentration of deer, elk, and smaller game were very valuable as a source of food for nearby settlements and cities. Though the 
widespread practice of farming domestic animals for food purposes has made hunting for sport much more common than hunting 
for food, certain animals such as geese, ducks, and deer are still frequently hunted and killed for food.
