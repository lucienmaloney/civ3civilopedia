^River deltas and other low-lying areas are often surrounded by poorly drained mineral beds. This leads to
the formation of marshes, large, water-logged areas vibrant with grasses and other plant life. Marshes are
often extremely complex ecosystems home to hundreds of different plant and animal species. Rice and other food
plants requiring large quantities of water can be grown in marshes, although the soil underneath may not be
sufficiently hospitable. Due to the soft nature of the ground, marsh is generally unsuitable for building
purposes.
