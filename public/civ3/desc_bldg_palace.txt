^When populations began to organize their communities into cities, their governments became more structured and formalized. 
At an early stage, the ruler of the city established headquarters from which the business of running the city was conducted. 
In many cases, these buildings also served as the living quarters of the ruler. In wealthy cities, these facilities often 
expanded into immense, sprawling palaces. These richly adorned, imposing buildings were a source of civic pride, and helped 
to reinforce the aura of power surrounding the ruler.
