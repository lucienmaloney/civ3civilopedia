#GOVT_Anarchy

^Anarchy is not so much a system of government as the lack of one. Your civilization can sink into anarchy 
if the government falls from prolonged $LINK<civil disorder=GCON_Disorder>, or if you sanction a 
$LINK<revolution=GCON_Revolution>. Anarchy seldom lasts longer than a few turns. During that period corruption 
and waste are so high that no production occurs and no taxes are collected. Scientific research comes to halt, as well.
There is no improvement maintenance when a civilization is in Anarchy.
