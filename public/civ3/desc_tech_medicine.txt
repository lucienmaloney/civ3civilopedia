^Primitive man attributed the onset of serious disease as the influence of the gods, or possession by evil spirits. Over time, however, it was 
found that such "possessions" could be treated through the use of elixirs made from plant extracts. Methods were also developed to clean 
and treat wounds, and set fractured bones. The ancient Greeks established the first schools to teach medical sciences circa 500 BC. The 
texts produced by the students of these schools, most notably Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, based his theories of 
the human body on observation and reasoning rather than supernatural intervention. Continued study of diseases over the years, combined 
with the dissection and study of the human body in the 13th century, pointed out flaws in early Greek theories, and led to more accurate 
medical texts based on detailed analysis rather than conjecture. By the 18th century, the same methods of analysis and observation used by 
scientists in other fields were applied to the study of medicine. This paved the way for the increasingly effective methods of treatment and 
surgery that have prevailed over the last 200 years.
