^{Diplomacy}
^Getting yourself elected to the head of the United Nations requires excellent diplomatic skills.
After the $LINK<United Nations=BLDG_United_Nations> is built, there
are periodic votes by the council to elect a Leader. To be elected, a candidate must win a majority of all votes.
If you are the one, you win the game.
^
^[Candidates]
^There are always two, and sometimes three, candidates. To be a candidate in an election a civilization must, either:
^	* have built the UN.
^	* control at least 25% of the world's territory.
^	* control at least 25% of the world's population.
^
^If only one civilization is eligible, then the second candidate is the civilization with the largest population.
^
^{Histograph}
^[Civilization III] runs until the year 2050. If the game ends and no one has won the space race, conquered or dominated
the world, wowed the world with cultural achievements or diplomatic aplomb, 
then the winner is determined by constructing a [histograph.]
^
^A histograph looks at the total "Score" generated by all civilizations turn by turn over the course of the game.
The civilization that generated the highest score -- on average -- wins. Being powerful in Ancient Times
is just as valuable as being powerful in the Modern Era.
