Civil Disorder
^
^
^[Civil Disorder] is a state of near anarchy in a city, in which the city essentially freezes and shuts down:
^* $LINK<Production=GCON_Shields> ceases,
^* No revenue comes in from $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and
^* No excess $LINK<food=GCON_Food> is stored.
^
^
^Prolonged periods of civil disorder can lead to:
^* Destruction of existing $LINK<city improvements=MENU_City_Improvements> or even sabotage to ongoing projects by angry mobs.
^* $LINK<Defection=GCON_Conversion> of the city to a nearby rival civilization with a strong culture.
^* An overthrow of your $LINK<government=GCON_Governments> and descent of your empire into anarchy.
^
^
^Civil disorder erupts when a city has more unhappy than happy citizens. The only remedy is to improve the 
$LINK<mood=GCON_Moods> of the people in the city.
