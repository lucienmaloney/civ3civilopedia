^The Berserk replaces $LINK<Longbowmen=PRTO_Longbowman> for the $LINK<Viking=RACE_Vikings> civilization.
In addition to being formidable foot soldiers, berserkers are one of the first available amphibious units 
in the game, which allows them to attack enemy units or structures directly from within sea-based transport vessels.
