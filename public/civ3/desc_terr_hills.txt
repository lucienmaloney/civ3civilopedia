^Hilly areas, often covered with rich soil and grasses or heavily forested, are rich in resources. Coal, iron, lead, copper, and even gold 
and silver may be found in these regions, making them profitable areas for the mining industry. In areas where the belowground 
resources are scarce, hill areas are often cultivated for agricultural purposes. Certain crops such as coffee and grapes thrive in 
these regions, given the proper climate.
