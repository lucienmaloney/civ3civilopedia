^Throughout the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the Roman Empire, the Christian Church was a major influence in the revival of 
European civilization. In recognition of the expanding influence of the church, great cathedrals were built in the largest towns and 
cities, to act as centers of religious study and worship. In addition to their religious significance, cathedrals acted as the center 
of social and cultural activity in the town. They brought great pride, stability, and tradition to the citizens of the community.
