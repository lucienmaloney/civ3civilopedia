#DESC_PRTO_Galleon

^By the late 15th century, oar-powered vessels had all but disappeared from the world's oceans, to be replaced 
by sailing vessels of various types. The galleon was one such vessel. Galleons were three- or four-masted 
ships, built high in both the forecastle and the stern. Developed in the 15th and 16th century, these versatile 
ships were mainly used as cargo vessels, although they were sometimes outfitted as light warships as well. 
Ships of this type served European nations well into the 1700s.
