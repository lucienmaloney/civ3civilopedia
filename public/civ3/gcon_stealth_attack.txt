Stealth Attack
^
^
^Stealth attack allows a unit to specify which enemy unit -- in a stack -- it will attack. As soon as a unit with stealth capability attacks a stack of enemy units, a selection box appears listing the target units. >From this box, you may select the unit to attack. The stealth unit then conducts its attack normally against the unit you've targeted.
