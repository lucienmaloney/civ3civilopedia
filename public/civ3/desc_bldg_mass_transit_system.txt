^Within a few decades of the invention of the automobile, the horse-drawn carriage disappeared from city streets. Along with all the 
advantages offered by the automobile, this new means of transportation quickly became a significant source of air pollution. As larger 
cities became more crowded, the number of cars increased, making travel difficult and adding to the pollution problem as automobile traffic 
clogged the streets. The development of mass transit systems, including busses, trolleys, subways, and light rail, led to a reduction in 
traffic and, as a result, a reduction in air pollution.
