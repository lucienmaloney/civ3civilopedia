#GCON_Shields
Production and Shields
^
^
^[Shields] represent [common] raw materials in the countryside [and] the labor
required to make useful materials from them. In essence they are a measure of [production].
^   The shields a city produces are used to complete its current project, which may be to build a military unit,
city improvement, or wonder. When the production box is full of shields, the project is finished,
the box is emptied, and a new project must be started.
^   Some cities lose shields to $LINK<waste=GCON_Corruption>.
^   Shield production depends upon the terrain within the city's radius, because citizens
laboring there produce shields. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.
