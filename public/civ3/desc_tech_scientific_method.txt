#DESC_TECH_Scientific_Method

^Mankind has always pursued an understanding of the universe that surrounds them. The scientific method lays down the blueprints for 
transmuting a theory into scientific law. The first step is to identify a process or phenomenon and begin to gather information about it. From 
this data, the scientist forms a hypothesis about the workings of the process observed. They then proceed to run a series of experiments to 
gather additional information that substantiates or disproves their theory. If the theory can co-exist with the findings, it can then be called a 
scientific law. Which is not to say that it cannot be disproved, as many such laws have become false as technology and new ideas are brought 
to bear.
