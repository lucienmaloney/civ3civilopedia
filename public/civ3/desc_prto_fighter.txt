^The earliest military aircraft were used primarily in a reconnaissance role. In 1915, during World War I, 
aircraft designer Anthony Fokker developed a gear system that allowed a plane-mounted machine gun to fire 
through the propeller, giving birth to the first fighter aircraft. The fighter's mission was to shoot down 
enemy reconnaissance and fighter planes. Later, as the use of bombers became more widespread, fighters were 
called upon to act as interceptors against enemy bombing runs and escorts for friendly bombers. The best way 
to ensure the safe passage of friendly bombers to their selected targets is the destruction of enemy fighters.
