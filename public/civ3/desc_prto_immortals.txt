^The Immortals were a strong corps of heavy infantry deployed by the Persian Empire in the fifth century BC.
Gifted soldiers, they drew their moniker from the fact that regardless of the casualties sustained in battle,
the unit was restored to full strength, no matter the cost. Equipped with bow and spear, the front rank would
advance upon the enemy while rear ranks rained arrows to ease the assault.
