^Few civilizations have left such an indelible mark on history as that of ancient Egypt. Though the first settlers 
of the Nile valley are thought to have arrived as early as 7000 BC, it wasn't until the legendary king Menes unified 
Upper and Lower Egypt that the region began to develop a cohesive sense of culture and identity. This First Dynasty 
(2925-2775 BC), with its capital at Memphis, was followed by 26 more over the next 2700 years. Writing was the major 
instrument in the centralization and self-preservation of Egypt. The two basic forms of writing, hieroglyphs and the 
cursive form known as hieratic (used on papyrus), were invented at much the same time in late pre-dynastic Egypt 
(about 3000 BC). Writing was used chiefly for administration and until about 2650 BC no continuous texts were recorded; 
the only literary texts written down before the early Middle Kingdom (1950 BC) seem to have been lists of religious 
practices and medical treatises. Another strength was the Egyptian religion, which was one of the most enduring of 
the ancient world, through which Egypt became a highly stratified, highly efficient society. Egypt�s economic strength 
allowed for the support of a priestly class, who were tasked with the spiritual well being of the people yet able to 
devote their time to the study of religion, astronomy, philosophy and mathematics. The priesthood also served the 
functions of a state bureaucracy, carrying out the edicts of the Pharaoh and managing his financial and diplomatic 
affairs. The great organizational and economic power of Egypt allowed the rulers to accomplish unmatched works of 
construction. The Great Pyramids of Giza, completed in the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2465 BC), still stand as one of mankind�s 
most impressive feats of engineering and logistics.
^    Previous to 1700 BC, no outsiders had ever held dominion over Egypt. That changed when the Hyksos, a Semitic 
people, overran Lower Egypt. Thereafter, Egypt�s borders were defended by capable Libyan warriors and the elite often 
rode into battle in {War Chariots}, which were able to use speed to outflank opponents and break up organized formations 
of troops. Egypt�s greatest military strength,
