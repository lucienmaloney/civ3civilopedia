War Weariness
^
^
^During times of war, citizens living under a $LINK<Republic=GOVT_Republic>, $LINK<Feudalism=GOVT_Feudalism>, or $LINK<Democracy=GOVT_Democracy> become [war weary] and $LINK<unhappy=GCON_Moods> as a result.
^
^When [you] initiate the conflict your people will tolerate it for a while, but then may become quite unhappy.
When someone else declares the war, especially a traditional enemy, your people are more forgiving.
Carrying on a defensive war, that is keeping your troops at home, is more tolerable than offensive campaigns.
^
^The only way to end [war weariness] is to stop the war. You can use all your normal tricks to
$LINK<make 'em happier=GCON_Moods>, but the war weariness remains until the war stops.
