Corruption and Waste
^
^
^[Corruption] is income lost to theft, embezzlement, and other illegal practices. [Waste] is shield production
lost to inefficiency. If left unchecked, corruption and waste will significantly slow the development of your
civilization. You can track the status of corruption and waste in your empire on the
[City Display] and [Domestic Advisor].
^
^
^{Causes}
^In general, the farther a city is from its capital city, the more corruption and waste it experiences. Also the more cities
in your empire, the higher rates of both, overall. Finally, the extent of corruption and waste is also affected by
the system of $LINK<government=MENU_Governments> you are currently using.
^
^
^{Solutions}
^A $LINK<courthouse=BLDG_Courthouse>, $LINK<police station=BLDG_Police_Station>, using Police Officers, or a nearby $LINK<Forbidden Palace=BLDG_Forbidden_Palace> and $LINK<Secret Police HQ=BLDG_Secret_Police_HQ>
reduces corruption.
^
^Another solution, is to change your system of $LINK<government=GCON_Governments>. The more liberal the
government, the less corruption and waste you experience.
^
^Being attached to your capital via road, harbor, or airport also reduces corruption and waste.
^
^$LINK<We Love The ____ Day=GCON_We_Love_The_King_Day> also reduces waste.
