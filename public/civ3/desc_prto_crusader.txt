#DESC_PRTO_Crusader

^Years of fighting in the Holy Land led to the development of a new class of Christian knight -- one
accustomed to harsh conditions and constant battle against opponents using unfamiliar and "un-Christian"
tactics. Crusader knights fought both mounted and on foot, and brought their experience and learned
ruthlessness and aggression back to Europe when the Crusades ended -- as in the case of the Teutonic
Knights, who offered to defend Poland from invaders and ended up taking charge of a big chunk of the
kingdom they promised to defend. Often originating in apparently benign orders (such as the Hospitallers,
who, true to their name, ran hospitals all over Europe), crusaders were often motivated by ambition and
the desire to rule their own kingdoms in the Near East.
