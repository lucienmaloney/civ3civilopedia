^The [Mayan Javelin Thrower] hurls javelins in rapid succession, using the [atl-atl]. He is strong on both the attack and on the defense. The Javelin Thrower also possesses the ability to "enslave". When the javelin thrower wins a battle, there is a 1/3 chance that the defeated unit will be �enslaved� and immediately turned into a Worker, which is then the property of the Maya.
