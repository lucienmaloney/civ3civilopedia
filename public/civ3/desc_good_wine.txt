^Wine, a beverage made from fermented grapes, was first produced as early as 6000 BC. Its use spread throughout the Middle 
East and Egypt, and it quickly became a popular beverage of the ancient world. The grapes used for the making of wine are 
grown in many different regions of the world. Most vineyards are located in hills and valleys of temperate regions. Wine making 
as an industry has been perfected over several centuries. Many regions such as the Rhine and Loire valleys of Europe are well 
known for their fine wines, and derive a significant portion of their economy from wine making.
