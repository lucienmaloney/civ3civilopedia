^The Hanging Gardens were a distinctive feature of ancient Babylon. They were a great source of pride to the people, and were often described in 
accounts written by visitors to the city. Possibly built by King Nebuchadnezzar II in 600 BC, the gardens are believed to have been a remarkable 
feat of engineering: an ascending series of tiered gardens containing all manner of trees, shrubs, and vines. The gardens were said to have looked like 
a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks, rising from the center of the city.
