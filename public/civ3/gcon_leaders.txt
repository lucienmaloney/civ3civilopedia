Leaders
^
^
^There are two kinds of great leaders: Military and Scientific.
^
^A {Military leader} is born in combat. This [can] occur when an $LINK<elite unit=GCON_Experience> wins a
battle. 
^
^A Military Leader can be used to either create an $LINK<army=PRTO_Army> or to
$LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> production of an Improvement or Small Wonder in a city. When a military
leader does either of these actions he disappears.
^
^
^A {Scientific leader} comes about as a result of $LINK<research=GCON_Research>. Each time a technology
is researched for the [first] time by any civilization there is a chance that a Scientific leader will arise
(this chance is increased slightly if the researching civilization has the "scientific"
$LINK<strength=GCON_Strengths>.
^
^A Scientific Leader can be used to increase the scientific output of all cities of his civilization, thus
starting an $LINK<Age of Science=GCON_Age_of_Science>. Simply move the scientific leader to your capital and
press the "Increase Scientific Output" button. A Scientific leader can also be used to
$LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> the construction of any [improvement] (including a Great Wonder) of the city
he's currently in. When the leader does either of these actions he disappears.
