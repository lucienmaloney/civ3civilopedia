^The catapult was one of the earliest forms of artillery. It was a large mechanical arm that propelled heavy 
stones and other missiles from a great distance, battering down walls and inflicting damage on buildings and 
defenders. Though cumbersome and nearly useless on the battlefield, the catapult was an effective weapon for 
siege operations.
