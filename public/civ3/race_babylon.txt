^Because of the historical significance and legendary status achieved by the city of Babylon, the term "Babylonian" 
is often used to refer to all of the ancient cultures and tribes of Mesopotamia. The oldest known urban and literate 
culture in the world was developed by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia beginning in the late 4th millennium BC. 
For centuries, Babylon was an insignificant suburb of the Sumerian capital of Ur until {Hammurabi} (1792-1750 BC) 
came to power. Hammurabi unified the bickering Sumerians and Akkadians and created the famous Code of Hammurabi, 
the most comprehensive code of laws of antiquity with 283 entries covering topics from criminal punishments to 
family laws. Under Hammurabi, Babylon became the commercial and political center of southern Mesopotamia, but

to help his Median wife overcome her longing for the "mountainous scenery" of her homeland. He also rebuilt the 
great Temple of Marduk and its ziggurat, collectively known as the Tower of Babel. Following Nebuchadnezzar's 
death, his successor Nabonidus failed to maintain the skilled {Bowmen} formations and the massive fortifications 
of the great city. When the Persians under Cyrus attacked in  539 BC, the capital fell almost without resistance. 
Babylon remained in Persian hands until Alexander the Great 
overthrew the Persian Empire. Alexander planned to make Babylon the center of his expanded Hellenic empire; however, 
he died in Nebuchadnezzar's palace before those plans could be completed. Alexander's empire would not
