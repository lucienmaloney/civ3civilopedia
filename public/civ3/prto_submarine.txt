#PRTO_Submarine
^
^
^[Submarines] can operate invisibly to enemy units because they travel beneath the waves. They remain
invisible until they attack a surface ship, after which they again disappear. However, other submarines
and $LINK<AEGIS Cruisers=PRTO_AEGIS_Cruiser> and $LINK<Destroyers=PRTO_Destroyer> can see them plainly. In addition, Submarines have $LINK<Stealth Attack=GCON_Stealth_Attack>.
^
^A coastal city needs $LINK<oil=GOOD_Oil> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build a sub.
