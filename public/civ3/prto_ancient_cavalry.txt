#PRTO_Ancient_Cavalry
^
^
^[Ancient Cavalry] represents highly trained mounted men, and thus receives an additional Hit Point on its Health Bar.
Like other fast units, Ancient Cavalry move quickly and will [withdraw] from combat if they are losing (unless fighting
another fast unit).
^
^The $LINK<Statue of Zeus=BLDG_Zeus> Great Wonder, unless rendered obsolete, automatically produces an Ancient Cavalry unit
every five turns.
