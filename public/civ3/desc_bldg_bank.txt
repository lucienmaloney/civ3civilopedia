^A highly developed banking system is one of the cornerstones of an advanced civilization. Banks lend money to individuals or groups, 
providing capital for industrial and real estate development. Banks also contribute to the economic growth of a city or region by stimulating 
the development of production facilities. Individual citizens can also benefit by investing their own surplus money in the bank and  earning 
interest on it.
