#DESC_PRTO_Ancient_Cavalry

^Given sufficient training and motivation, as well as better weapons and heavier armor, mounted troops can become
accomplished cavalry. By the time of Alexander the Great, both the Persians and Macedonians were fielding large
bodies of heavily-armed and armored cavalry. Cavalrymen of this time typically carried heavy spears, and some had round
shields. Alexander, noting the success of barbarian cavalry, introduced mounted bowmen and javelineers into his ranks.
The Athenians, in fact, were known to employ Scythian mercenaries as mounted archers.
