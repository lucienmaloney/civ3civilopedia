#PRTO_Galley
^
^
^The [galley] is a dangerous warship of the ancient era. A galley must end each turn in a $LINK<coastal=TERR_Coast> 
square -- they are in danger of sinking if they end their turn in a $LINK<sea=TERR_Sea> or $LINK<ocean=TERR_Ocean> square. 
If $LINK<The Great Lighthouse=BLDG_Lighthouse> is built, galleys may safely end turns at sea, but never ocean squares.
