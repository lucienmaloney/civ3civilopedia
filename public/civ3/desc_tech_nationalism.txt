^Nationalism is the belief that the affairs of the nation are the primary concern of its citizens. A recent political phenomenon (the first 
major application taking place after the French Revolution), it has nonetheless become the overriding paradigm for modern world politics. It�s 
important to know that nationalism can come in a variety of forms, some permutations bearing little resemblance to each other. Many early 
nationalistic leaders preached the superiority of their country over all others. While this type isn�t extinct today (as evidenced by the 
ethnocentric nationalism in the former Yugoslavia), most promote national determinism. Sanctioned by the United Nations, this is the belief that each 
nation should be responsible for its own growth and independence.
