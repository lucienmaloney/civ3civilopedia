#PRTO_Knight
^
^
^[Knights] are fast [and] powerful. They are the first armored unit, and good at attack and defense. Knights
will [withdraw] from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit).
^
^A city must have both $LINK<iron=GOOD_Iron> and $LINK<horses=GOOD_Horses> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS>
box to build knights.
