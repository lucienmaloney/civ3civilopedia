^The love of beauty seems a trait mankind was innately born with. When attempting to create things of beauty, and when done so skillfully, the
product is art. From our ancient cave dwelling ancestors to our electronically amplified contemporaries, painting, sculpture and music have all 
played a pivotal role in the quality of human life. A division can be made between the fine arts and the useful arts (such as pottery making or 
weaving), though the process through which the artists labor remains similar. Today commercial art is increasingly demanding to be 
considered a serious art.
