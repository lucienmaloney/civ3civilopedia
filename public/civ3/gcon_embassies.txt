Embassies
^
^
^When a civilization learns $LINK<Writing=TECH_Writing>, it can begin to build its intelligence network.
The first step is to build [embassies] in rival capital cities. That done, you can sign Right of Passage
$LINK<agreements=GCON_Agreements> and Military Alliances against third parties.
^
^When your empire has developed a sense of $LINK<Nationalism=TECH_Nationalism>,
you can engage in $LINK<Mutual Protection Pacts=GCON_Agreements> and Trade Embargoes against third parties.
^
^Embassies cost gold from your treasury to build, and diplomatic missions cost gold to execute.
^
^Build an embassy by double-clicking the capital city icon after you have learned Writing.
