^"Curragh" is an Irish name for a small boat made of skin stretched over a frame of wood. The origins of this small boat
date back many thousands of years, predating the more sophisticated and larger war galley. In the game the curragh
can represent any small boat (papyrus, wooden canoes or rafts, etc.) used by ancient people to expedite movement up and
down waterways and along coastal shorelines.
