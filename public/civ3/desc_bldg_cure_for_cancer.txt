^Despite the huge outlays of cash for research and study, cancer still looms as a terrifying and deadly plague on the human race. Although scientists 
and doctors have discovered many different forms of cancer, and have identified some of the factors that can trigger the disease, a true cure still 
eludes modern medical science. A cure for cancer would put an end to the source of much suffering and anguish, and allow millions of people, who 
would otherwise be doomed, to lead happy and productive lives.
