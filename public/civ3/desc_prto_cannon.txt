^Closely following the invention of gunpowder, the development of the cannon caused a revolution in siege 
warfare. Invented by a German monk in the 14th century, early cannons used gunpowder charges to fire rocks 
or metal balls. The cannon forced a redesign of most fortifications because the straight, high walls 
surrounding most cities could be easily destroyed by direct fire. This was the fate of the walls of 
Constantinople, which had held against countless sieges for over a thousand years. The cannon quickly 
assumed an important role on the battlefield.
