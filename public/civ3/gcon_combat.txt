Combat
^
^
^There are four types of combat: ground/naval combat, bombardment, missile attacks, and air combat.
^[Ground/Naval combat] occurs when units of different civilizations try to occupy the same square.
The two units trade blows until one of them loses its health bar and is destroyed.
The winner may be damaged (its health bar is reduced). 
^[Bombardment] occurs when a ranged unit or air unit attacks without entering the defender's square.
Bombardment inflicts losses to the defender's health bar but never completely destroys them.
Air bombardment is the same except the planes fly to the target and may be shot down on the way.
^[Missile attacks] are like bombardment, but the unit never returns to its base and the attacks can destroy enemy units.
^[Air combat] occurs between air units.

^{Repairing Damage}
^A unit that takes damage in combat but survives can heal, adding one $LINK<block=GCON_Experience> per turn back to
its health bar. To do so, it
^* must be in friendly or neutral territory.
^* must not move for a complete turn.

^{Repairing Faster}
^A city with a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks> heals ground units completely in one turn.
^A city with a $LINK<harbor=BLDG_Harbor> heals sea units completely in one turn.
^A city with an $LINK<airport=BLDG_Airport> heals air units completely in one turn.
^A civilization with $LINK<Battlefield Medicine=BLDG_Battlefield_Medicine> heals in enemy territory.
