Colony
^
^
^[Colonies] are built and maintained by a worker and enable exploitation of tradable $LINK<resources=GCON_ResourcesN>
that lie outside your $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory>. As with all tradable resources (strategic and luxury),
you need a road connecting the colony to one of your cities to get the benefits of the resource.
