^Warfare has been a recurring phenomenon throughout the history of mankind, and it continues to plague the world today. 
Although war is not a desirable situation, it is important that even the most peaceful of societies be prepared for the 
possibility of war. When warring nations are closely matched in technology and manpower, the army with the best training usually wins battles.
Military schools and academies exist all over the world, established for the purpose of training military 
personnel in the latest methods, tactics, and technology. Men and women who graduate from such facilities possess higher than 
average command and military and technological skills, making them more effective in combat situations.
