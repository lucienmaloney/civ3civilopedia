^In ancient times, almost every city had a temple dedicated to the city's patron god. Many cities also had temples dedicated to 
other gods as well. In modern times temples are thought of as places of worship, like churches and cathedrals. Ancient societies, 
however, considered temples to be the local dwelling place for the god or goddess to whom they were dedicated. The faithful citizens 
brought gifts of food, rare metals, and spices to the temple as a sign of homage and respect. The presence of a temple in the city 
had a comforting effect on the population, and wise rulers often constructed one as soon as the city began to grow.
