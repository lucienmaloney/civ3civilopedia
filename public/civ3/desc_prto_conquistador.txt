^Following Columbus, a Spanish military group known as Los Conquistadores, 'The Conquerors', were directed by 
Hernan Cortes to the New World with the sole purpose of seeking out new frontiers and riches in the unknown. 
The Conquistadores undertook their expeditions in the vast landmasses of the Americas at their own expense, 
risking their lives without aid from the Spanish royalty.  Horses adorned with many bells enabled the 
Conquistadores to launch indomitable offenses against the American Indian natives who had never seen a horse 
before the arrival of the Conquistadores.  Spanish-Conquistador conquests included campaigns in Guatemala, Peru, 
Cuzco, Columbia, Chile, the Bay of Honduras, and the Pacific Coastal regions.
