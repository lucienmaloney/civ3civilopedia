^While the bulk of a Celtic army would typically consist of poorly armored spearmen, it was the warrior nobles 
who wielded swords that were the most feared.  These Gallic Swordsmen were wealthier than their peers, and could 
afford to equip themselves not only with their slashing and stabbing sword, but also with a helmet and 
shield.  They often charged into battle bare-chested or completely naked, occasionally wearing vividly patterned 
pants or cloaks.  Similar to the Viking Berserker, Gallic Swordsman began their battles by viciously taunting 
their enemies, followed by a mad rush against enemy lines.  Celtic warriors were also known to serve as 
mercenaries to numerous armies of the classical period.  The best-known instance of this is when Celtic 
mercenaries joined Hannibal in his invasion of Italy during the 2nd Punic War, contributing to victories against 
Rome.
