Scientific Research
^
^
^Your civilization is constantly striving to learn about the world, science, invention, and creativity.
Its ability to succeed at these pursuits depends in large measure upon your allocation of revenue to science.
You set the allocation on the [Domestic Advisor] by sliding the science slider left or right to decrease
or increase (respectively) the amount of your tax revenue that you divert into research. By doing this,
you determine the percentage of each city's income that will be poured into research.
^
^At the start of each turn, the science output of each city is added to the research project currently
in progress, eventually resulting in the discovery of a new $LINK<Civilization Advance=MENU_Technologies>.
^
^To increase the science production in only one city, you can convert a citizen or two to a $LINK<scientist=GCON_Specialists>.
^
^Finally, the science output of individual cities -- and the empire overall, in some cases --
can be dramatically increased by building some improvements and wonders in those cities, such as:
