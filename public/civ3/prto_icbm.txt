^An [ICBM] (inter-continental ballistic missile) has an unlimited range, and like the tactical nuke, has a devastating effect. They cannot be moved from the

^A city must have $LINK<aluminum=GOOD_Aluminum> and $LINK<uranium=GOOD_Uranium> in its
$LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build ICBMs.
