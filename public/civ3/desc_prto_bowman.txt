^The Babylonians utilized a number of different archer types, typically categorized by the amount of armor they wore. These units
fulfilled a number of useful roles in the conquest-focused armies of the time, including sophisticated combined-arms tactics.
Their composite bows, when massed in sufficient numbers, could assist chariots and other horse units in disrupting lines and 
formations. When used in sieges, they would keep the ramparts clear of soldiers so that the infantry could safely close and 
scale the city walls. Sometimes these skilled warriors enjoyed the benefit of a shield 
carrier. These wicker, curved  shields would help protect the bowman from attacks coming from the front and above.
