^When your civilization builds an $LINK<embassy=GCON_Embassies> in a rival's capital city, or when a rival builds one

^
^
^{Right of Passage}
^You agree to allow his or her military units to move through your $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory> and use
your transportation network (roads and railroads).
^
^
^{Trade Embargo}
^An agreement that neither of you will $LINK<trade=GCON_Trade> with or [allow] trade with a third party.
^
^
^{Mutual Protection Pact}
^An agreement to declare war upon any civilization that attacks your partner.
^
^
^There is a fifth item that you can trade through your Embassies: {Communications}. These are
introductions to a third civilization you can grant or receive from a rival.
