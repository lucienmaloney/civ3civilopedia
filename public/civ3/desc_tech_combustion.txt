^The development of internal combustion was a great advance of the Industrial Age. German engineer Nikolaus Otto built the forerunner 
of todayï¿½s internal combustion engine in 1876. Refinements on Otto's design over the next ten years led to more efficient and powerful 
engines. The internal combustion engine forever changed world transportation. Early automobiles utilizing steam engines had proven to be 
both underpowered and impractical, but the fuel efficiency and compact size of the internal combustion engine allowed the automotive 
industry to flourish. Several variations, including the diesel engine designed by Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel, went on to revolutionize 
propulsion in shipping and other transportation industries.
