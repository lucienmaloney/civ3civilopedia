Commerce
^
^
^Commerce is the exchange of goods and cash between communities within and around a city, the exchange of
knowledge and ideas, travel and shopping. It is the commercial exploitation of goods and services within your society.
^
^Commerce production depends upon the terrain within the city's radius, because citizens
laboring there produce commerce. When the [City Display] is open, you can see what the citizens are producing.

^Note any square next to a river produces one extra commerce per turn, and 
some $LINK<natural resources=GCON_ResourcesN> provide bonus commerce as well.

^
^The government derives {Tax Revenue} from commercial activity and divides the revenue into three areas,
^* The build-up of liquid wealth in the $LINK<treasury=GCON_Treasury>,
^* Long-term investment in $LINK<scientific research=GCON_Research>, or
^* The entertainment of the population to produce $LINK<happy faces=GCON_Happy_Faces>.
^
^The allocation of tax revenues into these three categories is set using the Revenue Slider on the [Domestic Advisor].
