#PRTO_Cannon
^
^
^The cannon is a more advanced artillery unit, capable of bombarding adjacent targets to reduce them before
other units attack outright. Cannons have no attack or defense value, so they should be protected by an escort.
Further, they are wheeled units, so they cannot enter $LINK<mountain=TERR_Mountains>, $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano>,
$LINK<jungle=TERR_Jungle> or $LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh> terrain unless following a road.
^
^A city must have both $LINK<iron=GOOD_Iron> and $LINK<saltpeter=GOOD_Saltpeter> in its
$LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build cannon.
