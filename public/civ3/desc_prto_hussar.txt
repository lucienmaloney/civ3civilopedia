#DESC_PRTO_Hussar

^
^Light cavalry has been used in warfare since the domestication of horses, but in eastern Europe, Hungarian and Croat scouts earned a 
reputation for being elite scouts and deadly raiders.  Hussars were the result of other European nations' attempts to duplicate this sort
of unit.  Hussar uniforms are elaborate and dramatically colored, and becoming a hussar is often a great honor or awarded to those of 
noble birth.  They were typically armed with straight cavalry swords, although towards the end of the 18th century hussars often carried 
pistols as well.
