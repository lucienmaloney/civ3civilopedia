^Early humans were nomadic, settling in specific regions only for brief periods of time. When the food supply was exhausted in 
one area, the nomads would move on to search for more. Cities became possible only when the development of agriculture made 
the supply of food more abundant and dependable. However, cities still needed a way to keep the food supply stable throughout 
all four seasons. To do so, the citizens had to come up with a way to store seasonal crops for later use. The Granary was designed 
for the storage and protection of surplus food. Food storage technology meant that a smaller percentage of the population could 
produce and store enough food for everyone, allowing the remainder to pursue other jobs and activities.
