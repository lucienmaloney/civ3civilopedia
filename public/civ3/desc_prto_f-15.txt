^The successor to the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the F-15 was the first military aircraft with a genuine 
"look-down/shoot-down" capability, the product of pulse-Doppler radars that could detect fast-moving targets 
against cluttered radar reflections from the ground. Also designated the Eagle, the American F-15 was a 
twin-engine jet fighter produced by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. Based on a design proposed in 1969 for an 
air-superiority fighter, it has also been extensively used in fighter-bomber versions. For two decades, it was the 
primary fighter of the American Air Force. F-15s were delivered to the U.S. Air Force between 1974 and 1994, and 
since have been sold to American allies and assembled under contract in Japan. The "Strike" Eagle carried out much 
of the nighttime precision bombing of Iraqi installations during the Persian Gulf conflict (1990-1991), as well as
sweeping the Iraqi Air Force from the skies.
