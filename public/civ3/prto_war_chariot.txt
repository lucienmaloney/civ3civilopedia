#PRTO_War_Chariot
^
^
^[Egyptian War Chariots] take the place of normal chariots. They move quickly and will [withdraw]
from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit). War Chariots are wheeled, thus they may not enter
$LINK<mountain=TERR_Mountains>, $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano>, $LINK<jungle=TERR_Jungle> or $LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh> terrain
unless following a road.
^
^A city must have $LINK<horses=GOOD_Horses> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to
build a war chariot.
