emperor {Montezuma} II (1502-1520) succeeded his uncle Ahuitzotl as the leader of an empire 
that had reached its greatest extent, stretching from what is now northern Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua. 
The Aztec empire was still expanding, and its society still evolving, when its progress was halted in 1519 by 
the appearance of Spanish adventurers. Montezuma was taken prisoner by Hern�ndo Cort�s and died in custody. 
Montezuma's successors, Cuitl�huac and Cuauht�moc, were unable to stave off the conquistadors and, with the 
Spanish sack of Tenochtitl�n in 1521, the Aztec empire came to an end.
