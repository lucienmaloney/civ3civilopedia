#TFRM_Railroad
^
^
^Units moving along a railroad expend zero movement points. Railroads also increase the output of $LINK<irrigation=TFRM_Irrigation> or $LINK<mines=TFRM_Mine>.
^
^Workers can build railroads after the discovery of $LINK<Steam Power=TECH_Steam_Power>, but only if your
civilization has access to the $LINK<Strategic Resources Iron and Coal=GCON_ResourcesS>.
^
^Workers are ordered to build railroads by pressing [Shift-R] or the "Build Railroad" button.
