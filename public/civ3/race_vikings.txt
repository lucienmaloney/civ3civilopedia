^The suggested reasons for the appearance of the Vikings at the end of the 8th century in Scandinavia are 
varied. The most logical explanation to date is the possible overpopulation of the region.  An explosion in 
Nordic population throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark during the 7th and 8th centuries may have 
forced the indigenous people to explore and settle in more favorable territories. In addition, the gradual 
establishment of government throughout most of Western Europe augmented mercantile trade greatly as well as the 
opportunities for piracy. At home, these Scandinavians were independent farmers, but at sea or on the fields of 
war they were some of the fiercest warriors in the world.
^    The Scandinavian art of shipbuilding evolved during the course of the 8th century and greatly facilitated these 
early Viking expeditions and raids.  The most distinct differences between the Viking ships and their merchant 
vessel victims, was that the merchant ships were short, broad and relied on sail power, while Viking warships 
were longer, thinner and had a far greater number of oars and men. This made the Viking ships notably faster, 
and was instrumental in allowing the Vikings to penetrate long distances up rivers. Small armies of Viking 
longships negotiated the seas, utilizing hit-and-run tactics on the cities, towns, and villages that dotted the 
coasts of Europe. These longships were the very tools of Viking expansion.  The Vikings were able to raid far 
afield and subsequently colonize the lands that they plundered.
^    Viking hordes attacked England at the end of the 8th century, after which followed a period of relative calm 
that was shattered years later when attacks began anew. At first, the Vikings led nothing more than predatory 
raids in the summer months in search of booty and slaves, with no attempts at permanent settlement.  Beginning in 850 
however, there appeared to be changes in Viking strategy, for the first time, Vikings occupied entire villages 
and regions in the winters following their raids... they had come to stay.
