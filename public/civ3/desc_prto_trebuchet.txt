#DESC_PRTO_Trebuchet

^Siege weaponry and technology deteriorated during the Dark Ages.  However, the invention of the trebuchet in 
the 12th century reversed that trend.  The trebuchet represented a leap forward in siege engineering.  Instead of 
throwing missiles purely through torque, as the catapult did, the trebuchet used a sort of see-saw motion, with a heavy 
counterweight opposite the launching end to accurately throw rocks and other missiles great distances.  Some trebuchets were 
even adjustable, so their force, arc, and range could be changed by the crew without moving the contraption itself.
