^An active Civil Defense plan in times of war reduces loss of life and property resulting from enemy actions.  During the 
Second World War the threat of aerial attack on cities was sufficient enough that many cities implemented organized civil 
defense strategies.  Citizens were trained in fire fighting, rescue, medical first-aid and shelters were built to protect 
against bombing raids and other attacks.  Other tactics included power blackouts that significantly reduced the glow of 
city lights, typically used as guides by enemy pilots in bombing campaigns.  The introduction of nuclear weapons, capable 
of destroying entire metropolitan areas, caused radical changes in how civil defense is now approached, including: plans 
for mass evacuation, and prolonged residence in shelters.
