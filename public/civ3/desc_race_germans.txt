and decisive wars against Denmark, Austria and France by 
coalitions of German states. Bismarck had unified Germany.
^    The same nationalism that brought unity would bring disaster. Already staggering under a vengeful peace 
imposed by the Western Allies following World War I, the worldwide economic collapse that began in 1929 proved 
the catalyst for political extremism. Although bitterly opposed to each other, the Nazis and Communists during 
the next decade succeeded in mobilizing the political and economic resentments generated by defeat and depression.  
When Hitler finally became chancellor in January 1933, it was not on the crest of a wave of popular support but as 
the result of ruthless political intrigue.
^    World War II is appropriately called "Hitler's War." Spearheaded by {Panzer} 
formations using revolutionary new tactics, Hitler came close to realizing his aim of establishing German hegemony in 
Europe. But the turning point of the war came with his decision to send his Panzers into Soviet Russia. Though at the 
end of 1942 an ultimate German victory still seemed possible, by spring 1945 the Third Reich was prostrate. As a 
legacy of surrender and the ensuing Cold War, a truncated Germany was divided into two zones of military occupation. 
While under Soviet rule East Germany suffered and stagnated, West Germany's recovery from total economic and political 
prostration at the end of World War II was of such dramatic proportions as to become a modern legend.
^    The swift and 
unexpected downfall of the Soviet order in Europe led to a unification treaty, ratified by the West German Bundestag 
and the East German People's Chamber in September 1990. After 45 years of division, Germany was once again a united 
nation.
