^In Roman times Britain lay on the periphery of the civilized world, and it emerged into the light of history 
only after the Saxon settlements in the 5th century AD. Tribal migrations into Britain began about the middle 
of the 5th century. The first arrivals were invited by a British chieftain to defend his kingdom against the Picts 
and Scots. The first mercenaries were from three tribes - the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes - which located on the 
coastlands of northwestern Germany. Eventually, these peoples would themselves topple the native kingdoms. But 
unity was fleeting; the subsequent Norman Conquest (1066) resulted in the subordination of England to a Frankish 
aristocracy, and the introduction of feudalism to the Isles.
^    The English Normans would eventually give rise to a 
purely British line of kings, the Plantagenets. Three centuries later, the Wars of the Roses was the final struggle 
between the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of the Plantagenets for control of the throne. When Henry Tudor, earl 
of Richmond, seized the crown in 1485, leaving the Yorkist Richard III dead upon the field of battle, few Englishmen 
would have predicted that 118 years of Tudor rule had begun. {Elizabeth} I (1558-1603) proved to be the most able Tudor 
monarch. No observer in 1558, any more than in 1485, would have predicted 
that despite the social discord, political floundering, and international humiliation of the past decades, the kingdom 
again stood on the threshold of an extraordinary age. Her reign ushered in two centuries of British exploration, 
colonization, artistic and intellectual advances. When Elizabeth, the "Virgin Queen," died childless, Parliament 
offered the crown to the closest blood kin, James VI of Scotland (1603-1625) and the United Kingdom was born, 
defended by the "wooden wall" of the Royal Navy�s {Men-o-War}. 
^    Every major war Britain engaged in during this period increased its colonial power. The Seven Years' War 
was particularly notable in this respect, and so were the Napoleonic Wars. By 1820 the total population  
of the British Empire was 200 million, 26% of the world's total population. However acquired, all these
acquisitions added to the crown�s and the country's power and reputation. For the privileged and the rich, 
the Victorian era was pre-eminently one of confidence
