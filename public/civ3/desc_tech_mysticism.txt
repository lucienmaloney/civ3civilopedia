#DESC_TECH_Mysticism
^
^
^People of the ancient world were fascinated and awed by the forces of nature surrounding them. Earthquakes, storms and other phenomena 
were generally regarded as signs from heaven. Individuals and groups arose to formulate explanations for these events, and pass the 
knowledge along to the tribe. The priests and priestesses of mysticism, who were often called oracles, claimed union with the divine through 
meditation and trance-like contemplation. Primitive mysticism offered mankind the first, tenuous links with the powers that shaped their 
world, and represented the first move toward the organized polytheistic and monotheistic religions to come.
