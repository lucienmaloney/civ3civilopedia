of the Cold War, shook America's belief in its "victory culture" and "manifest destiny," a malaise that would not pass

human cost, but its sophisticated weapons - spearheaded by the American {F-15} fighters - caused heavy damage to 
Iraq's military and economic infrastructure. With the declining power (and subsequent collapse in 1991) of the 
Soviet Union, the war also emphasized the role of the United States as the world's single superpower at the beginning 
of the 21st century, its culture and technology spreading around the globe.
