^Groping for an explanation of the world around them, the earliest humans developed the first concepts of religion. Gradually, rites of worship 
grew to include sacrifices, ceremonies, vigils, symbology, sacred items, and prayer. One significant step in the advance of worship was the 
ceremonial burial, often a ritual preparation of the deceased's body for the afterlife his or her culture anticipated. The remains of ceremonial 
burials offer some of the most detailed information about past civilizations.
