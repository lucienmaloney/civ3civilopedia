^Cruisers have long served in the role of escort and defensive vessels, screening carrier task forces and 
amphibious assaults from enemy ships and aircraft. In recent years, the abilities of the cruiser have been 
upgraded significantly. In addition to their traditional five-inch guns, cruisers also carry batteries of 
Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles. The latest development in cruiser armament is the AEGIS surface-to-air missile 
system, which allows cruisers to target and fire their missiles more accurately and more effectively than ever 
before. The cruisers of today are highly capable of intercepting and destroying enemy submarines, surface ships, 
aircraft, and missiles.
