^The Hittites were perhaps most famous for waging fast, deadly warfare with their powerful
heavy war chariots.  The Three-Man Chariot was an improvement over other contemporary
chariots in close combat, because it sacrificed speed for stability and "elbow room" with
which to fight. At the battle of Kadesh, the Hittites used three-man chariots to closely
engage the Egyptian forces; this almost routed the entire Egyptian host.
