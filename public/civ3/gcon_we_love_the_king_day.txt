#GCON_We_Love_The_King_Day
We Love the __ Day
^
^
^At certain points in the game, if the population of a city has been well provided for and are happy, a city-wide
celebration will occur in that city, called "We Love the King Day" (or Emperor, or Regent, or President, etc.).
^
^The provisions for this to occur are:
^
^	The city cannot be starving,
^	The city cannot have any resisters,
^	The city cannot have any unhappy citizens,
^	There must be more happy citizens than content citizens, and
^	The city must be large enough (typically size 6).
^
^
^
^The benefits of having a "We Love the __ Day" celebration are:
^
^	The chance of the city converting to another civ is halved,
^	Waste in the city is reduced, and
^	The effectiveness of enemy spy propaganda missions against the city is reduced.
