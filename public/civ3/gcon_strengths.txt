Civilization Strengths
^
^
^There are eight areas in which civilizations have natural [strengths.] Each strength gives a civilization one free
Advance and one rules advantage as outlined below:
^
^
^{Agricultural}
^Agricultural city improvements (aqueduct, for instance) are easier to build, and the center city square
and irrigated deserts produce one more food.
^
^
^{Commercial}													
^The center city squares of all cities and metros produce extra $LINK<commerce=GCON_Commerce>, and less
$LINK<corruption=GCON_Corruption> is experienced.
^
^
^{Expansionist}												
^The civilization starts the game with a $LINK<scout=PRTO_Scout> and can build more later, and passive minor
$LINK<barbarians=GCON_Barbarians> are friendlier.
^
^
^{Industrious}										
^Workers complete $LINK<tasks=GCON_Worker_Jobs> faster and the center city square of all cities produces
extra $LINK<shields=GCON_Shields> in cities and metros.
^
^
^{Militaristic}													
^It is easier to build military improvements (barracks, for example), and combat $LINK<experience=GCON_Experience>
is gained more quickly.
