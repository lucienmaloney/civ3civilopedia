^One alternative to power generation utilizing coal or petroleum fuels is the hydroelectric power plant. This facility 
utilizes the energy of rapidly moving water to turn the turbines of its generators and produce electricity. In locations 
where a source of moving water is available, hydro plants offer a clean, safe alternative to coal, petroleum, and nuclear 
power generation. Hydro plants have their own set of  environmental dangers, however. The disruption of a river's normal 
flow and the massive flooding of the land behind the facility's dam can destroy the habitat of the wildlife inhabiting the 
river basin.
