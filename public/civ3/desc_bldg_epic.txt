^The Epic of Gilgamesh documents the adventures of this Middle Eastern hero. Of special interest to biblical scholars, the document was found 
among the ruins of Nineveh. More than 3000 lines, scribed across 12 tablets, this tale was written around 2000 BC. Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk, 
which now lies within the borders of Iraq.
