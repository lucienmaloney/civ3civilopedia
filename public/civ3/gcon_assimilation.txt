Assimilation
^
^
^[Assimilation] is the process by which $LINK<foreign nationals=GCON_Nationality> change their nationality
from one civilization to another. When a foreign national has been a part of a minority population longer than not,
he or she assimilates and becomes a member of the majority nationality.

^This process can take many turns, but the reduced risk of successful $LINK<hostile propaganda=GCON_Espionage> makes
it useful.
