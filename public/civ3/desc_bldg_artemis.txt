^One of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was an immense, grand temple and marketplace constructed of marble,
financed by the Greek king Croesus (whose name is now synonymous with great wealth). Filled with treasures and statues of bronze, gold, and silver from around
the civilized world, it stood for just two hundred years before it was burned by a fame-seeking arsonist. It was rebuilt twice, but never as grandly as it 
stood at its apex in the 6th century B.C. The Temple was destroyed for the last time by a Christian missionary and saint, who sought to eliminate this 
powerful symbol of the pagan world.
