#DESC_GOVT_Despotism
^Despotism is, without a doubt, the simplest form of government. It is based on a simple concept: might makes 
right. In a despotism, the power is held unquestionably by those who hold power over the military and who therefore 
can enforce their decrees. Because of the oppression experienced in this type of regime, despots often find that 
their ability to control the population is proportional to their use of armed troops in towns and cities in which 
the people live. Furthermore, because it is such a centralized form of government despotism makes it difficult to 
effectively put down rebellions and prevent the misappropriation of funds if their empire grows too large. Despots 
pay a terrible price in waste and corruption in their society; and with the development of more sophisticated forms 
of government despots often find that staging a coup is necessary for further growth.
