war machines that can [attack multiple times] in a single turn and [withdraw] from combat
if losing the fight (unless fighting another fast unit, of course).

^A city must have $LINK<aluminum=GOOD_Aluminum>, $LINK<oil=GOOD_Oil> and $LINK<rubber=GOOD_Rubber> in its
$LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to build modern armor.
