^Throughout history, animal furs have been valuable commodities for trade and sale. Many different 
types of animals including minks, rabbits, and beavers have been captured by trappers for the 
purpose of obtaining their pelts for use in the making of clothing and other items. The 
exploration and colonization of the New World caused the fur industry to boom by making a 
variety of furs readily available. By the late 1800s, farms were set up specifically to raise 
animals for the fur industry. Starting in the 1970s, environmentalists and animal rights groups 
have lobbied to change public opinion concerning the harvesting and sale of furs. Despite these 
vocal groups, the fur industry remains profitable, if not as wide spread, in the world today.
