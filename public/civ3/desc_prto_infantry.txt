^Modern infantry is given the challenging task of taking and holding terrain, which often involves dangerous,
close range fighting. Organized into small squads, their strength lies in their training and equipment (rifle, 
grenades, helmet, and other critical gear). Often individuals in the squad are trained to be specialists, allowing
them access to anti-tank weapons or light machine guns. Experienced in concealment and patrolling close to the enemy,
these hard-fighting men play an important and versatile role in modern military conflict.
