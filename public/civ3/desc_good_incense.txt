#DESC_GOOD_Incense
^

^A potent luxury today as well as throughout history, this dried perfume produces a potent and wide variety of odors when 
burned. Flowers, tree bark, wood, and resin all can create a specific smell that mankind has incorporated into many facets of 
their daily lives. One use of incense is with a �Censer�, which was an ornately decorated bowl. The ancient Egyptians used such
a device in many of their religious ceremonies. Two of the three gifts brought by the Three Wise Men to the birth of Christ were 
myrrh and frankincense, both types of incense. Today incense is used for the pleasing aromas they give off and for ceremonies 
in many Christian churches.
