^Some of the first anti-personnel devices created in Korea were comprised of small rockets attached to arrows, 
which flung spikes upon detonation.  When it was discovered that several of these rockets could be launched from 
the same container, larger versions of these anti-personnel devices were created and utilized in battle.  These 
larger anti-personnel devices were designed to be transported on wheeled vehicles such as a two-wheeled carts 
and wheelbarrows.  The Hwach'a, which was invented in 1451, allowed a single man to transport approximately 100 
rockets into battle, and was well suited to combat the invading Japanese Samurai who typically advanced on the 
Koreans in dense groups, presenting ideal targets for the Hwach'a operators.
