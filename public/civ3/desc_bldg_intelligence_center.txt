^The benefits of using spies and espionage in military matters were identified early in mankindï¿½s history. Both the pharaohs of Egypt and Caesars of 
Rome setup embassies in neighboring nations in order to monitor the expansion and movement of military forces. As technology increased the 
potential scale of warfare, it became critical to know from where and when threats would emerge. This can be seen in the plethora of methods used 
in acquiring information on a not-so-friendly nation. These include high altitude reconnaissance photography, actual battlefield observation, and 
covert missions. All this information usually focuses at the Intelligence Center, which collates and analyzes this valuable data from their diverse and 
remote sources.
