Specialists

^It is sometimes necessary to fine-tune a city's production. To do so, you'll want specialists.
Specialists do not work in the city radius so they don't contribute to city production of food or commerce.
Instead, they produce extra happy faces, enhance scientific research, tax revenue, or shield production, or
help control corruption.
