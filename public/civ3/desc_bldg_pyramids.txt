^Built by the fourth dynasty of Egyptian rulers, the Pyramids represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian cultural achievement. Constructed on the Giza 
plateau outside modern-day Cairo, these structures were burial tombs and monuments for the Pharaohs, and may have taken generations and tens 
of thousands of workers to complete. The Pyramids are the only one of the generally accepted man-made wonders of the ancient world that remains
in existence today.
