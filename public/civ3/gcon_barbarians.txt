Barbarians
^
^
^[Barbarian tribes] inhabit every continent of the world and there are two types: Passive and Aggressive.
^
^
^{Passive Tribes} 
^Passive barbarians reside in small villages. When you send a unit into one of these villages, several
things can happen -- some good and some bad. Possible results range from learning a new Civilization Advance 
to enraging the residents and having to battle them.
^
^
^{Aggressive Tribes}
^These [named] tribes also reside in villages on the map, but they send out raiding parties
to fight your units and pillage your cities and towns. By destroying a tribal village you can stop the raids from
that village. But the survivors will move to a new site in explored or unexplored $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory>
and begin raiding from there.
