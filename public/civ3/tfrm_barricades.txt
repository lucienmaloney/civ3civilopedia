#TFRM_Barricades
^
^
^A barricade hinders movement of "enemy" ground units, forcing them to stop on the barricade's square, even if the barricade
is unoccupied. However, if occupied, a unit in a barricade enjoy a defensive bonus which is double the bonus awarded by a $LINK<fortress=GCON_Fortresses>. A barricade can only be built on a square already containing a fortress. If pillaged, a barricade
is "reduced" to a fortress.

^Workers can build barricades after the discovery of $LINK<Construction=TECH_Construction>.
