^Wheat has been a staple crop for civilizations occupying temperate zones of the planet since pre-historic times. There is 
archeological evidence that bread wheat was cultivated in southern Turkestan as early as 6000 BC, though naturally occurring 
wheat was probably used for food purposes much earlier. Throughout the temperate zones, wheat has become the primary food 
crop. It is particularly well suited for growth in vast, open plains like those found in the central United States.
