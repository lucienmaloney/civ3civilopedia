^Toward the end of the 16th century CE, the independent cities and principalities of Flanders and Belgium sent
representatives to Utrecht to form an alliance. The alliance would coordinate taxation and military operations
against Spain, whose ruling Hapsburgs had dominion over the Low Countries even after they adopted the Protestant
religion. The Netherlands, comparatively small and poor compared to mighty Spain and its empire of gold in
the Americas, often had to rely on {Swiss mercenaries} and other hired guns for its defense. This was not a
long-term solution, hence the need for a much closer alliance. The result of this meeting was the Union of
Utrecht, which formally created the United Provinces of the Netherlands.
^    Spain, which had spent the previous decade alternately fighting and politicking against the armies and
intrigues of {William of Orange}, was not pleased by this development. Orange�s position had always been that
Spain�s sovereignty over the Netherlands was legitimate, but the governors chosen by the King were trampling
the rights of Orange and the other native nobles. William also vehemently opposed the imposition of Catholicism
on his homeland, but still felt the King of Spain could be persuaded to loosen his grip. This proved unrealistic,
and in 1581 Orange publicly renounced his loyalty to the Spanish throne. He was assassinated a few years later;
he did not live to see his country completely free of Spanish domination.
^    However, once the provincial leaders (particularly those of Holland, the largest and most influential of
the United Provinces) and the nobles began to cooperate, putting their disagreements to one side, Spain was
nearly defeated. Under the brilliant political, military, and economic leadership of Johan de Witt, perhaps
the Netherlands� greatest statesman, the Dutch Republic grew into a world power, its rapidly growing economy and
naval presence allowing it to settle colonies around the world and establish a massive trade empire. This
wealth translated into a cultural golden age lasting over a hundred years.
^    During that time, Dutch thinkers made fundamental contributions to philosophy, law, science, and art.
