^Manufacturing plants are large industrial complexes that produce goods of all types, although they are
generally used to produce durable consumer goods such as automobiles. Essentially, a manufacturing plant
is a large, sophisticated factory that employs specialization of labor, complex machinery, and assembly
lines to gain efficiency and economies of scale. This combination of manpower and automation increases
productivity and reduces production costs.
