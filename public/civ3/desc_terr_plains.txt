#DESC_TERR_Plains
^
^
^Plains are similar to grasslands, except that the topsoil is often not as well suited for growing food. Often, rich deposits 
of minerals are also found in plains regions. The indigenous plants of the plains make them well suited for grazing. Large herds of 
buffalo and other animals can often be found roaming the area. With the proper irrigation, plains can be easily cultivated into 
adequate farmland for the production of grains and the raising of livestock.
