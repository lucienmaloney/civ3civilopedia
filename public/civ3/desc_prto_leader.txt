^
^Throughout history special individuals have come to prominence on the world stage. Each embodied in some way the ideals and 
dreams of their people, causing legions to follow their lead. These great leaders of mankind were capable of feats that 
created benefits well beyond what they could achieve by themselves. On the battlefield, they inspired their troops to conquer 
their fear and accomplish goals thought impossible. Within civilian society, these figures corralled diverse goals and 
opinions into a powerful, unified focus. Once organized, these social entities became capable of pushing their society 
steadily into the bright future they all hoped to visit.
