#DESC_PRTO_Army
^Armies are the military forces of a nation, commissioned to defend the security of their country, as well as to protect its
interests across the world. Complex organizations, armies are capable of supporting extended campaigns in lands far from home.
They are frequently large groups of soldiers, though armies can be comprised of diverse combat specialties. Since these organs
wield considerable force, their integration and power within a nation's ruling body is heavily scrutinized.
