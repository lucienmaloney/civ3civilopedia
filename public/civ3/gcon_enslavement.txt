Enslavement
^
^
^Enslavement allows a unit to potentially "enslave" a combatant (instead of killing it) when it wins a battle. A unit with the "enslave" capability has a 1/3 chance of enslaving a defeated unit everytime it wins a battle. As soon as the battle is over, the game determines if the defeated unit is enslaved; if so, the unit is turned into another unit type (as specificed in the editor) and is immediately under the control of the victorious player.

^The $LINK<Privateer=PRTO_Privateer>, the English $LINK<Man-O-War=PRTO_Man-O-War>, and the Mayan
$LINK<Javelin Thrower=PRTO_Javelin_Thrower> have the Enslavement capability.
