^Modern France has its roots in ancient Gaul. In the 2nd century BC Rome intervened on the side of Massilia (Marseilles), 
a Greek colony founded in 600 BC, in its struggle against the barbarian tribes of the hinterland. The result was the 
formation, in 121 BC, of the Roman Provincia; between 58 to 50 BC Caesar seized the remainder. From 395 the internal 
problems of the Empire encouraged barbarian penetration of 
Transalpine Gaul. By 418, the Franks and Burgundians were established west of the Rhine, and the Visigoths had settled 
in Aquitaine. The period of the Merovingian and Carolingian Frankish dynasties (476-887) frames the Early Middle Ages. 
^    Following his ascension, the first Merovingian, Clovis (481-511), consolidated the position of the Franks in northern 
Gaul. Clovis came to believe that his victories were due to the Christian God. Clovis' subsequent conversion assured 
the Frankish rulers of the support not only of the Catholic Church but of the majority of their own subjects. By the 
rise of the house of Valois in 1328, France was the most powerful kingdom in Europe. Its ruler could muster larger 
armies than rivals; he could tap enormous fiscal resources; and the king's courts maintained royal supremacy. The 
history of France in the Late Middle Ages is dominated by efforts of its kings to maintain their suzerainty, efforts 
that, despite French advantages, were long frustrated. 
^    The Hundred Years War was an intermittent struggle between 
England and France in the 14th-15th centuries over a series of dynastic disputes, including the legitimate succession 
to the French crown. The war's turning point was reached in 1429, when an English army was forced to raise its siege 
of Orlï¿½ans by a relief force organized by {Joan of Arc}. Her insistence that only consecration at Reims could make a 
true king, chosen by God, led to further victories. Charles III was anointed in Reims in July 1429. By 1453, England 
retained only Calais, which it finally relinquished in 1558.
^    With the ascension of the infant Louis XIII (1610-1643), the security of the country was again threatened as factions 
disputed the throne. Crown and country, however, were rescued by the most controversial
