^The Muslim states were themselves supplanted by the Mughul Empire (1526-1761 AD), founded by Zahir-ud-Din 
Muhammad Babur (1526-1530 AD). Babur was a Mongol, a fifth-generation descendant of Timur and a 14th-generation 
descendant of Genghis Khan. In a lightning series of campaigns commencing in 1511 AD, he overran the Punjab and 
Hindustan. Akbar the Great (1556-1605 AD), his grandson, continued the conquest of the subcontinent, overrunning 
Gujarat, Bengal and Rajasthan. At its zenith, the Mughal realm commanded resources unprecedented in Indian history 
and covered almost the entire subcontinent.
^    The 16th and 17th centuries also saw the establishment and expansion of European trading organizations in 
the subcontinent, principally for the procurement of rare resources. By 1740, the Portuguese, Dutch, English and 
French had all founded colonial settlements, but with the Seven Years' War the French holdings were surrendered 
to the British East India Company. The quarter-century following the bitter Indian revolt of 1857-59, which transferred 
the company's rule to the crown, ended with the birth of nationalist agitation.
^    The Indian National Congress held its first meeting in December 1885 in Bombay even as Indian troops were 
fighting in upper Burma under the British flag. {Mohandas Gandhi} (1869-1948), later known as Mahatma ("Great-Souled"), 
was recognized throughout India as the spiritual leader of a nationwide movement for independence. The Jallianwala 
Bagh (1919) massacre turned millions of moderate Indians from patient and loyal supporters of the British raj into 
fervent nationalists. The last years of British rule were racked by increasingly violent Hindu-Muslim conflict and 
intensified opposition to foreign rule. In July 1947, Britain's Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act, ordering 
the demarcation of the dominions of India and Pakistan by midnight of August 14, 1947, and dividing within a single 
month the assets of history's largest and richest colony.
