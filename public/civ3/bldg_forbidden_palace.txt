#BLDG_Forbidden_Palace
^
^
Gives similar benefits as the $LINK<Palace=BLDG_Palace> but still suffers some corruption. By building the Forbidden Palace you also increase the optimal number of cities for your civilization to have. This amount is relative to map size, difficulty, and current government choice. This is cumulative with $LINK<Secret Police HQ=BLDG_Secret_Police_HQ>.
^{Requires:} The civilization must have at least ten cities (on a standard size map) under its control.
