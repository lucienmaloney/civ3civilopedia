^Destroyers are small escort ships that serve a variety of useful functions. These light, fast vessels were 
used extensively in World War II to provide air and sea cover for carrier groups. One of the primary functions 
of the destroyer is to locate and destroy enemy submarines. Using their sonar equipment to locate the subs, 
and their batteries of depth charges and torpedoes to destroy them, the destroyer forces of World War II were 
the key to the success of many crucial naval operations. Modern destroyers are still used in much the same 
role, as escorts for larger vessels and as submarine hunters. In addition to five-inch guns, the arsenal of 
today's destroyer includes anti-submarine helicopters, anti-ship cruise missiles, and the Phalanx system for 
defense against anti-ship missiles.
