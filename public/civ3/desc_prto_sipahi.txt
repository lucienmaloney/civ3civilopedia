^During the 15th century and beyond the Ottomans imported expertise in firearms and gunpowder.  A form of Turkish 
heavy cavalry, known as Sipahi, became the predominating military unit utilized by the Ottoman Empire.  The 
earliest variations of these soldiers were well-armored men on well-armored horses, who typically used a mace 
as their primary weapon.  During the 17th century the Sipahi replaced their archaic weaponry with sabers and 
pistols, establishing them as a fearsome presence on the battlefield.  While European infantry were more than 
a match for the standard Ottoman infantry, the Sipahi were far superior to any medieval knights.
