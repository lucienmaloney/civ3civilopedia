^Despite political and social upheavals that frequently ravaged the country, China is unique for its longevity 
and resilience as a politico-cultural entity. Most of China's cultural progress has been accomplished with relatively 
little outside influence; even when the country was ruled by such "barbarian" peoples as the Chin or Mongols, these 
were soon absorbed into the fabric of Chinese culture. The casting of bronze and the development of an alphabet date 
from the period of the Shang dynasty - China's first, believed to have dominated north China from the mid-16th to 
mid-11th century BC. The overthrow of the Shang dynasty by the Chou (1111-255 BC) spanned three generations; although 
the vibrant Chou culture produced some of history's greatest philosophers and artists, among them Confucius and Lao-zi, 
it was eventually supplanted by a "barbarian" invasion that established the brief Ch'in Empire (221-206 BC). 
The subsequent Han dynasty was founded by Liu Pang, who assumed the title of emperor in 202 BC. The four centuries of 
the Han was one of considerable changes in imperial, political, cultural and social development, as well as massive 
engineering projects (including the Great Wall), and established a Chinese identity that would survive until the 
advent of Communism.
^    By the end of the 2nd century AD the Han Empire had virtually ceased to exist, followed by a lengthy period of
rival kingdoms that did not end until 618 AD, when the T'ang dynasty came to power. The T'ang were followed by the
Sung dynasties (960-1279 AD), which collapsed in the face of the Mongol invasions. By securing the allegiance of
the Hsi Hsia in Tibet (1209), Genghis Khan disposed of a potential enemy and prepared the ground for an invasion
of China. For several years Mongol armies pillaged the country; finally, in 1214 Genghis overwhelmed the capital
of the northern Chin (modern Beijing). During the next decades there was an uneasy truce between the Mongols in the
north and the Sung state in the south. The Mongols resumed their advance in 1250 under Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis.
