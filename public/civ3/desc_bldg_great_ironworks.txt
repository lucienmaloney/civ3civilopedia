^As mankind�s dependence on metals increased through the ages, it became very important to cheaply and effectively separate the base metal from 
impurities. The process of smelting, through the use of a structure called a blast furnace, achieved just that. Using carbon dioxide created from 
oxidized coke to absorb the oxygen from the molten iron, it leaves the metal �slag� to sink to the bottom of the furnace. This separation allows for 
a pure iron to be derived, which is then used for numerous purposes, including the creation of steel.
