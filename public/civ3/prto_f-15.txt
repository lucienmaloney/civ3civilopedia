#PRTO_F-15
^
^
^Like other jet fighters [F-15s] are faster versions of their predecessor and F-15s pack very potent attack power.
They may execute all $LINK<air missions=GCON_Air_Missions> and have [radar] that 
allows them to "see" two squares, regardless of blocking terrain. They may be based in any city or aircraft carrier
on the map. In addition, F-15's have $LINK<Stealth Attack=GCON_Stealth_Attack>.
^

^The F-15 has both Lethal Land and Sea Bombardment.

^An American city needs $LINK<oil=GOOD_Oil> and $LINK<aluminum=GOOD_Aluminum> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box
to build an F-15.
