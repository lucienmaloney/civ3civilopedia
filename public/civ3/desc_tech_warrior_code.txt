^The Samurai of feudal Japan lived by a doctrine known as "Bushido", or "the way of the warrior". This code of behavior stressed such virtues 
as loyalty, courage, and politeness. The honor of the warrior could only be maintained if the rules of the code were followed. A similar code 
of behavior known as chivalry was later developed under the feudal system in medieval Europe. Although the strict adherence to both 
Bushido and chivalry were abandoned along with the feudal system in the 1800s, certain principals of discipline and behavior inherent in 
these systems can still be found in the military today.
