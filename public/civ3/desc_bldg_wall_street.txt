^The location of the New York Stock Exchange, Wall Street has become the epitome of the modern financial district. A narrow street running from 
Broadway to the East River, it houses some of the world's most prestigious and powerful banks and commodity exchanges. In 1653 Dutch colonists 
erected a barricade along this route to ward off the British and unfriendly natives.
