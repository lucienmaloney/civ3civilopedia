^
^Primitive artillery, [catapults] are devastating siege weapons in Ancient Times. They are used to
$LINK<bombard=GCON_Combat> city defenses to soften the attack for accompanying soldiers.
Catapults have no attack or defense power, so they should be protected by an escort. Finally,
catapults are wheeled so they may not enter $LINK<mountain=TERR_Mountains>, $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano>,
$LINK<jungle=TERR_Jungle> or $LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh> terrain unless along a road.
