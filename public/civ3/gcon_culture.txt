Culture
^
^
^[Culture] represents the impact of your civilization's customs, arts, and philosophy on the people
in the countryside surrounding your cities, and is represented in the game by $LINK<borders=GCON_Territory>.

^{City Cultural Value and Borders}
^All Wonders of the World and many city improvements generate culture points every turn. These accumulate
over time and when the total culture value of a city reaches certain thresholds (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000, etc.),
a [border expansion] is triggered. Pay attention to the culture box on the [City Display] to judge
when expansions will occur. The amount of culture each Wonder or improvement contributes doubles after 1000
years.

^{Civilization Culture Value}
^The sum of the cultural values of all of your cities is your [civilization's cultural value.]
It comes into play when you conquer an enemy city (and $LINK<resistance=GCON_Resistance> is determined),
conduct diplomacy with a rival, or when you and a rival both have a legitimate claim on a terrain square.
In all cases, if your civilization is more valuable culturally than your rival, that's good --
and the greater the discrepancy between you, the better.

^
^{Global Cultures}
^There are five global cultures in the game: Amerindian, Greco-Roman, European, Far Eastern,
and Middle Eastern. Global culture determines the look of cities and citizens, and nations
of the same global culture tend to start near each other and are more tolerant in diplomacy.
