^Smart weapons are those that utilize targeting mechanisms external to it. A good example of this is the �Maverick� munitions, which 
use a separate laser to �designate� the bomb�s target. The source of this laser can be a plane, a soldier close to the target, or even an orbiting 
satellite. With the target �painted� by this laser, the Maverick can adjust and refine its path to the target based on the laser�s reflection. 
Another type of smart weapon is one that uses a TV camera to feed visual information to a human technician. Using this information they 
could make small or great course changes throughout the flight, right up until impact. A benefit of both these types of guidance is extreme 
precision. Since many modern conflicts  take place among non-combatants, these high tech weapons can ensure that only the 
actual target is affected by the attack.
