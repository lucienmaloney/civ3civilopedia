^Before the spread of Islam and the Arabic language, the term "Arab" referred to any of the nomadic residents of 
the Arabian Peninsula. When used in a modern context, "Arab" refers to any of the Arabic-speaking peoples who 
reside on the Atlantic Coast of Africa, Southwestern Iran, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi-Arabia, Syria, and Iraq.  The 
earliest nomadic inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula herded their sheep, goats, and camels through an unforgiving 
desert environment; while those Arabs who settled in the oases provided date and cereal agriculture as trade staples 
for Arab caravans that transported spices, ivory, and gold from southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa to the 
civilizations farther north.
^    During the 7th century AD, Muhammad emerged as the prophet for the religion of Islam, which was widely adopted

standardized style of writing for laws and other texts.  New institutions also emerged, including: coinage, 
territorial deities, royal priesthoods, and standing armies, which further enhanced Arab power.  Adherence to the 
religion of Islam has become a global phenomenon.  Muslims predominate in approximately 30 to 40 countries, from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific and along a belt that stretches across northern Africa into Central Asia and the northern 
regions of the Indian subcontinent.  Despite the absence of any large-scale Islamic political entities, the Islamic 
faith continues to expand, by some estimates faster than any other major religion.
^    By proclaiming his message publicly, Muhammad gained followers.  {Abu Bakr} is noted as being the first male 
convert to Islam and also as Muhammad's closest companion and advisor.  At the point of Muhammad's death, on June 
8th, 632 AD Muslims resolved the crisis of succession by accepting Abu Bakr as the first Caliph.  In his rule as
