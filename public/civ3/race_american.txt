^The United States is relatively young by Civilization standards, being barely more than 200 years old; it achieved 
its current size and influence only in the mid-20th century. America was the first of the European colonies to separate

new capital.

mere passing episode in the history of modern warfare, but it catapulted the United States into the world arena. 
Before the 1890s, roughly speaking, most Americans had stubbornly adhered to the belief, as old as the
