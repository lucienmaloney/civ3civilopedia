^The Pentagon is the largest office building in existence. The structure was completed on January 15, 1943, during the height of the Second World War, after a crash building effort of only 
16 months. The 83 million dollar facility covers more than six million square feet, roughly three times that of the Chicagoï¿½s Sears Tower (the second largest office building). Originally a US Army facility,
it soon became the nerve center for all military branches of the United States.
