^The concept that was to become the modern helicopter was first explored by artist/engineer Leonardo da Vinci. 
He made sketches of a rotor-driven aircraft in the early 16th century. It was not until 1939, however, that the 
first practical helicopter design was developed. Helicopters have a distinct advantage over fixed-wing aircraft 
in that they can take off and land vertically. This makes it possible for helicopters to operate in many places 
that would be too small to accommodate a runway. Today, helicopters are used in civilian roles as rescue 
vehicles and by law enforcement agencies. All branches of the military utilize many different types of 
helicopters, from giant cargo and troop carriers to fast and maneuverable gunships used as air support for 
ground troop operations.
