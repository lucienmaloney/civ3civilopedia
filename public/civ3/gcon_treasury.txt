Treasury
^
^
^The [treasury] is where your empire's wealth is stored. Each turn, the net income from each of your cities is combined,
costs are deducted, and the remainder is placed into your treasury. On some turns, gold may have to be drawn out of the
treasury to cover costs. Balancing your need to spend with your need to build a substantial store of liquid wealth is
an interesting challenge.
