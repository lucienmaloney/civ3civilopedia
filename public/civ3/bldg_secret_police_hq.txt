#BLDG_Secret_Police_HQ
^
^
Gives similar benefits as the $LINK<Palace=BLDG_Palace> but still suffers some corruption. By building the Forbidden Palace you also increase the optimal number of cities for your civilization to have. This amount is relative to map size, difficulty, and current government choice. This is cumulative with $LINK<Forbidden Palace=BLDG_Forbidden_Palace>.
^{Requires:} Only civilizations under Communist government can build the Secret Police HQ. Changing from Communism will cause the Secret Police HQ bonuses to stop.
