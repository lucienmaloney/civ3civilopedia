^Austria, located in lower Central Europe north of the Balkans, first coalesced as a nation in the early Middle Ages by the margrave 
Leopold of Babenberg, a regional noble who in the 10th century C.E. pushed the Magyars from that area and formalized a system of common law.  
But it was not until three hundred years later that Austria would take the first steps towards great power status.  A Hungarian noble, Otakar II, 
took advantage of a succession dispute in 1254 and married into the Babenberg line.  As a response, the German nobility in Bavaria and elsewhere 
felt concerned, and began a long campaign to undermine and eventually depose Otakar.  The German army's commander, a relatively obscure noble from a minor family, was then elected king of Germany to 
reward his successes.  His name was Rudolf of Hapsburg.  The Hapsburgs would become one of Europe's most powerful families; the seat of their power was 
Austria.
^    In 1519 Martin Luther posted his famous 95 Theses, and at the time the Hapsburg emperor was {Charles V}, a devout Catholic and harsh ruler.  Forced to rule 
two essentially foreign countries -- Austria and Spain -- Charles did his best, but made many mistakes and alienated many nobles before he was able to successfully 
ride two of Europe's strongest horses at once.  Moreover, Charles' fervent opposition to Protestantism as well as his well-founded concerns regarding the Hapsburg 
rights in western Europe diverted his attention from the threat of the Ottoman Turks (whose ships already ruled the Mediterranean).  He used severe measures to put down 
rebellions in lower Austria and in the Netherlands, and even allowed an unpaid and hungry army to sack Rome over a grudge against the Pope.  Nonetheless, Charles 
dealt successfully with a huge number of threats, minor and major, to the Austrian empire, and he also managed to keep the Turks at bay.  He even managed to expand the 
empire, by acquiring the Portuguese succession rights.  His greatest ambition, to bring all Protestants back into the Church, was obviously a failure, although he made 
several sincere (and even nonviolent) attempts to bring this about.
^    After Charles' death, the empire steadily grew, adding Bohemia to the northeast.  The new Emperor, Ferdinand, wished to extend his
