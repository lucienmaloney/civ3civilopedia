^Loosely speaking, Iroquois is the term for any member of the Five (later, Six) Nations composed of several 
Native American tribes speaking a language of the Iroquoian family: the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, 
and Tuscarora (after 1722). At its greatest extent, the Five Nations occupied a vast territory around Lakes Ontario, 
Huron and Erie, in present-day New York state and Pennsylvania and southern Ontario and Quebec. Tradition credits 
the formation of the Iroquois Confederacy, forged between 1570 and 1600, to Dekanawidah, born a Huron, who is said 
to have persuaded {Hiawatha}, an influential Onondaga who had become the Mohawks' war chief, to abandon cannibalism 
and advance "peace, civil authority, righteousness, and the great law" as sanctions for confederation. Cemented mainly 
by their desire to stand together against invasion, the five tribes united in a common council composed of clan and 
village chiefs; each tribe had one vote, and unanimity was the rule. In this form, the Iroquois used a combination 
of military prowess and skilled diplomacy to conquer an empire. Until their internal unity finally failed them during 
the American Revolution, the Iroquois dealt with even the European powers as equals.
^    For nearly two centuries before the American Revolution, the Iroquois stood athwart the path from the Eastern 
coast to the Great Lakes, blocking the route to permanent settlement by the French and containing the Dutch and the 
English. Throughout the 18th century the Six Nations remained consistent and bitter enemies of the French, who were 
allied with their traditional foes, the Algonquins and Hurons. The Iroquois' success in maintaining their autonomy 
from both the French and English was a remarkable achievement for an aboriginal people. But during the American War 
of Independence, a schism developed within the Iroquois Confederation. The Oneida and Tuscarora espoused the American 
cause, while the rest of the league, led by Chief Joseph Brant's Mohawks, fought for the British, decimating isolated 
American settlements.
