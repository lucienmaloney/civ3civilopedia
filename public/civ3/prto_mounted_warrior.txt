#PRTO_Mounted_Warrior
^
^
^[Iroquois Mounted Warriors] take the place of $LINK<horsemen=PRTO_Horseman>. They move quickly and will [withdraw]
from combat if they are losing (unless fighting another fast unit).
^A city must have $LINK<horses=GOOD_Horses> in its $LINK<Strategic Resource=GCON_ResourcesS> box to
build a mounted warrior.
