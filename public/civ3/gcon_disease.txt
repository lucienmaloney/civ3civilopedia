Disease
^
^
^[Disease] kills citizens and units that spend too much time in unhealthy areas like
$LINK<floodplains=TERR_Flood_Plain>, $LINK<jungles=TERR_Jungle> and
$LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh>. Military units that fortify in these terrains are susceptible
to [disease].
^
^Your workers can $LINK<clear jungles or marsh=TFRM_Clear_Wetlands> and eliminate that risk.
Floodplains continue to be risky until you discover $LINK<sanitation=TECH_Sanitation>.
