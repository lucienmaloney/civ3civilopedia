^Eventually, the villages, fields, orchards and granaries, as well as the morale of the Iroquois, were destroyed 
in 1779 when Major-General John Sullivan led a retaliatory expedition of 4000 American regulars, and crushed their 
assembled warriors near present-day Elmira. Having finally acknowledged defeat in the Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix 
(1784), the Iroquois Confederacy effectively came to an end by ceding western Pennsylvania, New York and Kentucky to 
the United States. At the end of the Revolutionary War, there were less than 8000 Iroquois left. Even the 1940 U.S. 
census listed only 17,000 Iroquois in both the United States and Canada, but current figures approach 70,000 in about 
twenty settlements on eight reservations in New York, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Ontario and Quebec.
