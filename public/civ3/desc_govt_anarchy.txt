#DESC_GOVT_Anarchy
^Change of rule in cultures are often periods of unrest, but when the very framework for government is transformed 
it almost always results in a period of anarchy. The massive political and social upheaval experienced by the 
culture during a period of anarchy brings commerce and production to a standstill as cities rise up and government 
organizations try to restructure. Despite the fact that corruption and waste are absolute, there is a positive side 
to anarchy - it is temporary. When the smoke clears and the citizens calm down they are ready to embrace a new form 
of order in your society.
