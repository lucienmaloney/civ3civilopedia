^Upon coming to power, one of Shaka's first acts was to reorganize the Zulu army. Shaka first rearmed his men with 
long-bladed, short-hafted stabbing assegais, which forced them to fight at close quarters. He then instituted a 
regimental system based on age groups, quartered at separate kraals (villages) and distinguished by uniform 
markings on shields, headdress and ornaments. And he developed standard tactics, which the Zulu used in every 
battle thereafter. Each impi was divided into four groups. The strongest, termed the "chest," closed with the 
enemy to pin him down, while two "horns" raced out to encircle and attack the foe from behind. A reserve, known 
as the "loins," was seated nearby, with its back to the battle so as not to become unduly excited, and could be 
sent to reinforce any part of the ring if the enemy threatened to break out. Besides their prowess in battle, the 
Zulu warriors could cover tremendous distances, an impi consistently covered 50 miles a day, living off grain and 
cattle requisitioned from the kraals it passed and accompanied by young boys who carried the warriors' sleeping 
mats and cooking pots.
