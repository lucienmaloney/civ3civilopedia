^The Sumerians were, by historical consensus, the first human civilization. Originally from Asia Minor, they settled between the 
Tigris and Euphrates (in modern-day Iraq) and began to farm and create simple goods. They relied on a sort of theocratic city-state government, 
where each Sumerian city worshipped a separate god and had a separate governor, although all paid tribute to a single King in the capital, Ur.
^    Sumeria's first and greatest accomplishment was the extent to which its people controlled their environment. They drained swamps, dug canals, 
and generally bent the Euphrates region to their needs. They plowed the land for the first time in history, and took advantage of the rich, fertile 
Mesopotamia soil. However, the area was low on other resources, so the Sumerian city-states were forced to import goods (particularly metals). Thus they 
had to create a barter system of trade, as well as riverboats to more easily traverse the rivers that flanked their home. The invention of the plow led in 
turn to the invention of the wheel, which permitted animals to pull carts as well as plow fields, and also to the creation of better pottery (with potters' 
wheels).
^    Since specialists were now able to create goods, and not every man had to farm, full-time priests could administer community affairs as well as the 
temples in each city. To support them, in turn, people had time to devise picture signs and other very early alphabets, and being a full-time scribe became a 
viable profession. The literature of Sumeria followed thereafter, culminating in the Epic of {Gilgamesh}, a lengthy poem dedicated to the mythic god-king whose 
real and legendary exploits blend together. A companion of Gilgamesh, Enkidu, fought by Gilgamesh's side in many battles, and for him the {Enkidu Warriors} are 
named: fierce fighters who sought to defend Sumerian lands from the other civilizations being born nearby.
