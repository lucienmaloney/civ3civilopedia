^Humans have witnessed the phenomenon of electricity in the forms of lightning, static electricity, and magnetism since the dawn of time. 
Electricity was not seriously studied, however, until the 17th century. Early electrical pioneers studied various electrical phenomena, and built 
devices both to generate and to measure electrical charges. In 1892 Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, a Dutch physicist, advanced the electron 
theory. This theory, which explains electricity as a reaction between positively and negatively charged electrons, formed the basis for modern 
electrical theory. Based on Lorentz's work, early engineers such as Thomas Edison pioneered methods allowing the widespread use of 
electricity as a power source.
