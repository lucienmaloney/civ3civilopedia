Air Missions
^
^
^Air units are not moved around the map like other units. Instead, they are stationed in a city,
and assigned missions which they execute immediately against targets within their operational range.
^
^When an air unit is active, choose the mission you want it to perform (command button or hot key) and
choose a target within the plane's range.
^
^{Air Superiority (S)}
^The plane attempts to intercept enemy aircraft that attack targets within the inner half of its operational range.
^
^{Bombing Mission (B)}
^The plane flies to the target and attacks, sometimes affecting city improvements,
and sometimes population.
^
^{Precision Strike (P)}
^Performed by $LINK<stealth aircraft=PRTO_Stealth_Fighter>,
precision strikes destroy city improvements only, unless there are none in which case population is affected.
^
^{Recon Mission (R)}
^The plane flies to the target and reveals the map.
^
^{Re-Base Mission (Ctrl-R)}
^The unit can be moved to another city or a $LINK<carrier=PRTO_Carrier> a distance equal to up to Six
times the plane's operational range.
