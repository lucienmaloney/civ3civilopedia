^The threat of nuclear war became the backdrop of world politics after World War II. This terror sparked a fifty year long 
conflict, the Cold War, between the two leading super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States. Although there was no 
direct armed conflict between these two nations, the conflicts fought over their opposing ideologies often served to 
heighten tensions and fears of a nuclear holocaust, from which nothing might have emerged. Integrated defense was a concept 
born of the Cold War. Using satellite intelligence and laser designation, it was believed, a shield could be erected to 
pinpoint and destroy all high altitude threats through lasers or missiles. Although no such defense shield was ever erected, 
the theory behind a national anti missile shield still remains a viable option, especially against a "rogue state" scenario 
in which there are a very small number of inbound targets to eliminate.
